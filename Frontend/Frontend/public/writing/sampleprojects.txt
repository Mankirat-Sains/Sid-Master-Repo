RELEVANT PROJECT EXPERIENCE
Project 1 — Academic Medical Center Inpatient Tower & Campus Infrastructure Expansion

Project Overview
Our firm provided full structural engineering services for a new inpatient tower constructed within an active academic medical center campus. The project included a multi-story inpatient tower with deep basement levels, pedestrian bridge connections to existing hospital buildings, and extensive below-grade infrastructure integration. Construction occurred immediately adjacent to occupied clinical facilities, requiring precise coordination and phased execution.

Structural Scope & Complexity
The project required design of a reinforced concrete superstructure supported on deep foundations due to poor subsurface conditions and high groundwater levels. Below-grade construction extended multiple levels below grade and required detailed evaluation of hydrostatic uplift, waterproofing coordination, and shoring systems. The tower connected to existing hospital buildings via elevated pedestrian bridges, necessitating careful consideration of differential movement, structural compatibility, and long-term serviceability.

Relevance to Cooper University Health Care
This project closely mirrors the structural challenges anticipated for Cooper’s Tower A and campus infrastructure. Key similarities include deep basement construction, integration with existing healthcare facilities, pedestrian bridge design, and phased construction within an active hospital environment. The project also required early structural system decisions that preserved flexibility for future campus expansion—an approach directly applicable to Cooper’s master planning objectives.

Project 2 — Urban Healthcare Campus Parking Structure & Clinical Support Building

Project Overview
Our firm served as structural engineer for a multi-level parking structure and adjacent clinical support building serving a dense urban healthcare campus. The project was delivered as part of a long-term campus redevelopment plan and required coordination with future expansion zones identified in the master plan.

Structural Scope & Complexity
The parking structure utilized long-span concrete framing to maximize efficiency and incorporated provisions for future vertical expansion and rooftop mechanical screening. Foundations were coordinated around existing utility corridors and adjacent building foundations. The project also required extensive constructability review to support phased construction while maintaining uninterrupted access to hospital operations.

Relevance to Cooper University Health Care
This project demonstrates our experience with healthcare-adjacent structures that must operate continuously while supporting future growth. The structural approach to long-span framing, durability, and phased construction is directly applicable to Cooper’s planned parking, infrastructure, and support facilities. The emphasis on lifecycle performance and adaptability aligns with Cooper’s long-term campus strategy.

Project 3 — Central Energy Plant Expansion & Underground Infrastructure Facility

Project Overview
Our firm provided structural engineering services for the expansion of an existing central energy plant and the construction of a new underground infrastructure facility supporting a regional medical campus. The project included structural evaluation of existing buildings not originally designed for vertical expansion and new below-grade construction housing critical MEP systems.

Structural Scope & Complexity
The project required detailed analysis of existing structures to verify capacity for additional mechanical loads, rooftop screening structures, and vertical expansion. New underground structures were designed to resist full hydrostatic pressure and accommodate heavy equipment loads with strict vibration criteria. Coordination with MEP engineers was central to the project’s success.

Relevance to Cooper University Health Care
This project is highly analogous to Cooper’s Boiler House expansion, geothermal infrastructure, and campus-wide energy systems. It demonstrates our ability to assess existing structural capacity, design for critical infrastructure, and integrate structural solutions with complex mechanical systems—all key components of the Cooper Master Campus Plan.
