However, the documentation lacks specific methodologies for ongoing monitoring and testing of the post-tensioning system. Regular inspections and testing are essential to detect potential issues early, particularly in moisture-prone areas. The industry recommends scheduled inspections every three to five years for aging garages, including evaluations of moisture protection systems and testing of tendons. A robust repair and maintenance program is vital for preserving structural integrity and extending the lifespan of the post-tensioning system, thereby enhancing safety and usability.
