        "answer": "Based on the provided context, the following projects feature a floating slab foundation:\n\n## Residential Projects\nProject 25-01-084 - Project Name: Justin McKeen - 29' x 31' Floating Slab, Project Address: 20 Feeder Canal Road, City: Dunnville\nThis project features a floating slab design with thickened edges. The main slab area is 29' by 25', with an additional 11' 6\" by 17' 6\" section. Reinforcement includes (4) 15M rebar and either 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh (WWM) or a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid. A thermal break at the porch uses 12-inch long 15M rebar dowels spaced at 16\" on center. The thickened edge has a 2% slope grade away from the structure. The sill plate is secured with 1/2-inch diameter bolts at 48\" on center. The foundation includes a minimum of 2\" (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation with a concrete compressive strength of 30 psi. The base is compacted granular 'A' with an optional 6mil poly vapour barrier.\n\nProject 25-01-073 - Project Name: Alexis Galvao 30' x 32' Floating Slab, Project Address: 6498 Quarry Point Road, City: Ramara\nThe floating slab foundation measures 32'-0\" by 28'-0\" and is reinforced with (2) 15M rebar, each 2'-0\" long. The design includes 30\" x 30\" x 18\" thick pad footings. The thickened edge section has a sill plate secured with \u00bd\"\u00d8 anchor bolts at 48\" on center. Reinforcement options include 6x6x\u00bd WWM, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh. The foundation has a minimum of 2\" (R10) extruded polystyrene insulation with 30 psi compressive strength, an optional 6mil poly vapor barrier, and a compacted granular 'A' base. The perimeter slopes away at a 2% grade.\n\nProject 25-01-070 - Project Name: Gary Giles 26' x 30' Floating Slab, Project Address: 104 Sturgeon Glen Road, City: Kawartha Lakes\nThis floating slab foundation measures 30'-0\" by 26'-0\" and features a thickened edge detail reinforced with (4) 15M continuous rebar. The sill plate is secured with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center. Slab reinforcement options are 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh. The slab rests on a base of compacted granular 'A' and has an optional 6 mil polyethylene vapor barrier. The design specifies a 2% slope grade away from the structure for drainage.\n\nProject 25-01-064 - Project Name: Paul Wiley 25' x 33' Garage, Project Address: 28 Tecumseh St, City: St. Catharines\nThe project includes a floating slab foundation with a footprint of 33'-0\" by 25'-0\". The thickened edge is reinforced with (4) 15M continuous rebar and has a sill plate secured by 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts at 48\" on center. Slab reinforcement options include 6x6x6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fibre mesh. The foundation is built on compacted granular 'A' material with an optional 6 mil poly vapour barrier. A 2% slope grade away from the slab is required for water runoff.\n\nProject 25-01-028 - Project Name: Rob Lachapelle - 18' x 22' Garage Review, Project Address: 123 Dodson Street, City: Hamilton\nThis project's floating slab foundation measures 18'-0\" by 22'-0\". It features a thickened edge reinforced with four 15M rebar and a sill plate with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center. The design includes a minimum of 2\" of extruded polystyrene insulation with a 30 psi compressive strength and an optional 6mil poly vapour barrier. Reinforcement options are 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fibre mesh. The slab is supported by a compacted granular 'A' base and has a 2% slope grade away for drainage.\n\nProject 25-01-019 - Project Name: Wayne Mckeown 24' x 35' Floating Slab, Project Address: 1182 Barton St, City: Hamilton\nThis residential project uses a floating slab design measuring 24' by 35'. Reinforcement includes (3) 15M rebar at the top and bottom of load-bearing edges, plus (2) 15M hooked bars. The foundation is anchored with Hilti Kwik Bolt 3 Wedge Anchors with 4\" minimum embedment. It includes a minimum of 2\" (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation (30 psi compressive strength), a 6 mil poly vapor barrier, and a base of compacted granular 'A'. The slab is reinforced with 6\"x6\"-6/6 welded wire mesh or a 10M grid at 10\" on center and has a 2% slope for drainage.\n\nProject 25-01-014 - Project Name: Conner Brydges 52' x 60' Floating Slab, Project Address: 2310 Line Road 6, Beckwith\nThe floating slab foundation for this project measures 60' by 52'. The thickened edge is reinforced with four 15M rebar bars and the sill plate is secured with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts at 48\" on center. Slab reinforcement options include 6x6x6 welded wire mesh (WWM), a 16\" by 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh. The design specifies a minimum of 2\" (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation with 30 psi compressive strength, an optional 6 mil poly vapor barrier, and a compacted granular 'A' base. An intermediate thickened strip footing, reinforced with two continuous 15M rebar bars, provides additional support.\n\nProject 25-01-002 - Project Name: Dwayne Goodyear 30' x 40' Floating Slab, Project Address: 17/184015 Bondiss Drive, Fort McMurray\nThis project features a 40' by 30' floating slab with a thickened edge detail and an 8\" poured concrete curb. The curb is reinforced with 15M rebar, 20\" long, spaced at 32\" on center. The sill plate is secured with 1/2-inch diameter anchor bolts at 48\" on center. Slab reinforcement options are 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" by 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh. The design includes a minimum of 2\" (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation (30 psi compressive strength), an optional 6-mil poly vapor barrier, and a compacted granular 'A' base. The grade is sloped away at 2%.",
