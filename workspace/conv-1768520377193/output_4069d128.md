While our documentation offers insights into post-tensioned structures, it does not cover specific floating slab projects or methodologies. Standard practice in floating slab construction emphasizes moisture protection and detailing around expansion joints to prevent water infiltration, which is vital for structural integrity. Floating slabs are designed to accommodate soil movement and provide stable foundations, particularly in areas with expansive soils or frost heave concerns. Key considerations include effective waterproofing membranes, proper drainage systems, and regular maintenance to address potential water ingress. Advanced materials and techniques, such as encapsulated post-tensioning systems, can further enhance durability and reduce water-related damage risks.
