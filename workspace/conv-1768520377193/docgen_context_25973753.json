An optional 6mil poly vapor barrier can be included.\n- Drainage: The perimeter is designed with a 2% slope grade away from the structure.\n\nProject 25-01-070 - Project Name: Gary Giles 26' x 30' Floating Slab, Project Address: 104 Sturgeon Glen Road, City: Kawartha Lakes\nThis project features a floating slab foundation measuring 30'-0\" by 26'-0\".\n- Thickened Edge: The slab has a thickened edge detail (section callout '2/S1') reinforced with (4) 15M continuous rebar.\n- Anchoring: A sill plate is secured with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center, with openings left at door locations.\n- Reinforcement: Slab reinforcement options include 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh.\n- Base: The slab is built on compacted granular 'A'. An optional 6 mil polyethylene vapor barrier is included to prevent moisture ingress.\n- Drainage: A 2% slope grade away from the slab is specified for drainage.\n- Insulation: Insulation is optional to enhance thermal performance.\n\nProject 25-01-064 - Project Name: Paul Wiley 25' x 33' Garage, Project Address: 28 Tecumseh St, City: St. Catharines\nThis project's foundation is a floating slab with a footprint of 33'-0\" by 25'-0\", detailed in the 'PLAN FLOATING SLAB'.\n- Thickened Edge: The 'SECTION THICKENED EDGE' (2/S1) shows the edge is reinforced with (4) 15M continuous rebar.\n- Anchoring: A sill plate is secured with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center. Openings in the sill plate are required at door locations.\n- Reinforcement: The slab is reinforced with 6x6x6 welded wire mesh or a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid. Fibre mesh is an alternative.\n- Base: The foundation rests on compacted granular 'A' material. An optional 6 mil poly vapour barrier is included.\n- Drainage: A 2% slope grade away from the slab is mandated for water runoff.\n\nProject 25-01-028 - Project Name: Rob Lachapelle - 18' x 22' Garage Review, Project Address: 123 Dodson Street, City: Hamilton\nThis project uses a floating slab foundation system measuring 18'-0\" by 22'-0\", as shown in the 'PLAN FLOATING SLAB'.\n- Thickened Edge: The thickened edge detail (section '2/S1') is reinforced with four 15M rebar.\n- Anchoring: The sill plate is equipped with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center.\n- Insulation: The design includes a minimum of 2\" of extruded polystyrene with a compressive strength of 30 psi.\n- Reinforcement: Slab reinforcement options are 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fibre mesh.\n- Base: The foundation is built on a compacted granular 'A' base. An optional 6mil poly vapour barrier is specified.\n- Drainage: A 2% slope grade away from the foundation is required for drainage.\n\nProject 25-01-019 - Project Name: Wayne Mckeown 24' x 35' Floating Slab, Project Address: 1182 Barton St, City: Hamilton\nThis project has a floating slab foundation with dimensions of 24' by 35'.\n- Reinforcement: The slab is reinforced with (3) 15M rebar at the top and bottom of load-bearing edges, with additional (2) 15M hooked bars.
