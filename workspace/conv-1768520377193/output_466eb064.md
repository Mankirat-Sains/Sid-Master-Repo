While design specifications and construction methods for floating slab foundations are not fully detailed, standard practices involve a reinforced concrete slab on granular material to allow movement and reduce stress. Typical specifications include a slab thickness of 4 to 6 inches, steel reinforcement for tensile strength, and proper drainage to prevent water accumulation. Floating slab foundations generally utilize concrete, steel reinforcement, and waterproofing membranes to guard against moisture. Reinforcement often includes rebar in a grid pattern, particularly in high-load areas. Construction methods typically involve site excavation, drainage layer installation, reinforcement placement, and concrete pouring, with proper curing and finishing being crucial for durability.
