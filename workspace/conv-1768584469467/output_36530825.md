When designing a steel beam, understanding structural requirements and risks associated with post-tensioning technology is vital, especially in environments like parking garages. For example, the Juravinski Concession Garage employs post-tensioning technology in its slabs and beams, which differs significantly. The slab strands are “unbonded,” providing flexibility but increasing the risk of corrosion if water infiltrates. In contrast, beam tendons are bonded, which limits corrosion to a localized area but complicates repair processes (as noted in the findings section).

A critical consideration in beam design is load-carrying capacity, which can be severely affected by localized water infiltration. The unbonded slab strands can extend up to 160 feet, meaning that a single broken strand can compromise the entire slab length. Corrosion in bonded tendons affects only a localized area, yet repairs are more complex and costly. Industry practice often recommends carbon fiber reinforcement or external post-tensioning as effective repair methods for deteriorated beams.

The reviewed documentation does not specify the exact steel material properties or design loads for the beams. It is standard to consult the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) guidelines for these parameters. Furthermore, the encapsulated system in the Juravinski Garage, featuring epoxy-coated anchor hardware and watertight seals, underscores the importance of moisture protection in prolonging the lifespan of post-tensioning systems.

To mitigate risks, ongoing maintenance and evaluation are essential. While the existing encapsulation may offer adequate protection against water infiltration, monitoring the integrity of moisture protection systems is crucial, particularly in leak-prone areas. A professional assessment every three years, including detailed reviews of moisture protection systems and random sampling of post-tensioning integrity, is advisable to proactively address potential deterioration.
