Great! How do i know what type of functions to add to my system?

Hereare some questions pople may ask:

what is the size of the building (dimensions)

What is the volume of steel? (calculated from length of material and member type),

What is the Spans of members.....

Spacing between parallel members on same level (claculated for trib width)

Dimesnison, elevations, how members connect, tracking loads... (Ie..this column is taking loads from thesebeams)

With all of this info, hypothetically we will be able to track loads in a system
