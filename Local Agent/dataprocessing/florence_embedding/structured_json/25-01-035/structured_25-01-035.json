The typical exterior porch foundation wall is a 10-inch concrete foundation with 2-15M rebar at the top. Upper-level exterior walls include brick veneer and siding options, both with insulation, sheathing, and gypsum board. Interior party walls and firewalls are described with gypsum board, wood studs, and mineral fiber insulation, offering fire resistance ratings and sound transmission class values.",
