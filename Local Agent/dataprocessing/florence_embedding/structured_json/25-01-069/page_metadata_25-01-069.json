      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a detailed plan and notes for a slab-on-grade foundation, primarily for a floating slab. It includes general notes on foundations and concrete, specifying materials, construction methods, and conditions for the slab. The drawing features a plan view of the slab-on-grade and section details illustrating construction methods. Key components include the slab-on-grade foundation and associated structural notes. The sheet is intended for the foundation level of the building."
