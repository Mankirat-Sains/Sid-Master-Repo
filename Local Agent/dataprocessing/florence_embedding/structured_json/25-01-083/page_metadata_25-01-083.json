      "general_notes_verbatim": "To whom it may concern,\nWaddell Engineering Ltd. (WEL) has been retained to provide a structural review of the design for the project mentioned above.\nBackground:\nA site inspection of the referenced project was conducted on January 14, 2025, by WEL personnel. During this inspection, it was discovered that the W200x21 steel beam in the basement was cut too short and is not supported by the foundation wall at each end. Instead, this beam was supported by a built-up 4 ply 2x6 post at both ends. This is shown in Figures 1 and 2 below.",
      "page_overview_summary": "This page is a structural memo from Waddell Engineering Ltd. regarding a steel beam at 26 Nelson St. The memo describes a site inspection revealing that a steel beam in the basement is inadequately supported by temporary posts instead of the foundation wall. The document sets the context for the structural review and includes images of the existing conditions."

This post shall be installed as per the manufacturers recommendations and fastened to the bottom flange of the beam. The 2x4 stud wall that will be installed next to the foundation wall shall have a stud installed tight to against each side of the steel beam.\nThe strip footing shall be widened with a 36” x 18” x 10” thick footing installed below the post and doweled into the existing strip footing as shown in Figure 4.\nComments:\nIt is the opinion of Waddell Engineering Ltd. that the design is structurally adequate and agrees with the Ontario Building Code.\nAny questions or comments can be directed to the writer.\nRegards,\nSam DesRoches P.Eng.",
