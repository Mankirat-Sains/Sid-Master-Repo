      "summary": "This plan view highlights the basement beam that requires support, as indicated in Figure 3. The drawing shows the layout of the basement, including dimensions such as 38'-3\" and 30'-7\" for overall exterior openings. Key components include the basement beam, beam pockets, radon mitigation measures, and the basement floor slab. Notes specify the use of double rim joists over basement windows and the need for gas-tight sealing of division areas. The plan also includes dimensions for various sections of the basement, such as 16'-7 1/4\" and 11'-3\". The beam is highlighted as needing support, and the plan provides a visual reference for its location within the basement.",

      "summary": "This detail page outlines the proposed repair for the basement beam support. The temporary wood posts are to be replaced with teleposts rated for a minimum factored load of 6,000 lbs. The teleposts will be installed according to manufacturer recommendations and fastened to the beam's bottom flange. The strip footing will be widened to 36” x 18” x 10” and doweled into the existing footing. The diagram shows the footing detail, including 6” compacted granular fill below the footing, 3” bottom cover, and 2” side cover. Additional components include 1/2\" anchor bolts at 16\" O.C., a drainage layer, and continuous insulation. The design is deemed structurally adequate by Waddell Engineering Ltd. and complies with the Ontario Building Code.",
