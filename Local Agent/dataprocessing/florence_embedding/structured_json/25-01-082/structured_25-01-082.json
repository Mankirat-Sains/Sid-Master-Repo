      "summary": "This detail drawing from Waddell Engineering Ltd. and BGL Contractors Corp. illustrates a lifting lug designed for a check valve. The lug is engineered to handle a maximum load of 5 kN, as specified in the design loads. The drawing includes dimensions such as a diameter of Ø64 mm for the main hole and Ø22 mm for typical holes, with a thickness of 19 mm. The lug must be used with minimum 50.0 mm diameter shackle pins for vertical lifts only. The material specified is ASTM A36 or equivalent mild steel, which must be hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication. The drawing notes that all welding must conform to CSA W59 standards and undergo visual inspection and testing as per CWB requirements. The lug is to be anchored to a 712 mm concrete beam using a 19 mm threaded rod embedded a minimum of 125 mm with Hilti HY200. The drawing also specifies that two assemblies are required, and the weight of the check valve to be lifted is 457 kg. The lifting lug welds require 100% magnetic particle inspection (MPI), and rigging is to be provided by others.",
