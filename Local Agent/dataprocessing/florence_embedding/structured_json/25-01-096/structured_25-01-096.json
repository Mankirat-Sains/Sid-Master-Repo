      "summary": "This detail illustrates the timber porch design, emphasizing that all timber framing is D. FIR. The rafters are 4x8, spaced at 32 inches on center, supporting an 8x10 ridge beam. Continuous vertical blocking matches the beam width, and the framing follows the plan. A 3-ply 2x10 beam is specified, with columns per plan. The 8x10 beam can be built up as required or replaced with a larger beam. The design includes one king and two jack studs. Elevation markers indicate the top of the ridge beam, heel, and beam, with a 1-foot overhang and a 3-foot 4-inch height to the top of the floor/grade. The drawing is certified by S. Desroches, a licensed professional engineer in Ontario, dated January 19, 2025.",
