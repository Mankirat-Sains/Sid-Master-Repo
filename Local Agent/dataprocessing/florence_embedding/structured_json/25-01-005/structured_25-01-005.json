The legend identifies symbols for bearing walls, fire stops, pre-engineered trusses, and continuous purlins, with a reference to detail 3/S4. The roof plan notes specify the provision of attic fire stops using 7/16\" OSB secured to trusses or 2x3 framing, ensuring continuous support for all joints. No compartment dimension should exceed 98'-4\", and fire stops must not interfere with roof ventilation. Attic hatches are required in each attic portion, and trusses must bear directly to posts. All dimensions must be confirmed before ordering trusses, and 'X' bracing of truss laterals is required as per manufacturer shop drawings, with reference to detail 1/S6. Overhangs are to be constructed as dimensioned.",
