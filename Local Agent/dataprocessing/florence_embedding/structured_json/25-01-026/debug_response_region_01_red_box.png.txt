      "summary": "This image contains foundation plan notes and schedules for various foundation wall assemblies and ledger details. The legend defines symbols used for indicating the bottom of the cold room foundation relative to the foundation wall. Foundation plan notes specify that all fasteners into treated wood must be ACQ rated, and masonry support above doors and windows requires steel angles or rebar. Exterior strip footings are detailed as 24 inches wide by 8 inches thick, set 4 feet below grade on undisturbed soil. The foundation wall assemblies include various wall types (W1 to W7), each with specific concrete and insulation requirements, and anchor bolt spacing. The ledger schedule specifies a 2x6 ledger secured with screw anchors. These notes and schedules provide comprehensive instructions for constructing the foundation elements, ensuring proper support and insulation."
