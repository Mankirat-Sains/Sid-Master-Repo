      "summary": "This image presents a comprehensive schedule of various building assemblies, including foundation wall assemblies, main floor assemblies, roof assemblies, floor assemblies, and ceiling assemblies. Each assembly type is detailed with specific construction methods and materials. For example, foundation wall assemblies like W1 and W2 consist of 8\" poured concrete with rigid insulation and anchor bolts, referencing specific details such as 3/A3.2. Main floor assemblies include exterior walls with vinyl siding, Typar housewrap, and batt insulation, with specific wall types like W8 and W9 designed per building codes. Roof assemblies, such as R1 and R3, describe pre-engineered truss roofs with specific strapping and sheathing requirements. Ceiling assemblies detail interior and sloped ceiling constructions with batt insulation and drywall. The schedule provides a detailed overview of the construction specifications for each assembly, ensuring compliance with building standards and providing guidance for construction.",

      "summary": "This section view provides a longitudinal cut through the building, illustrating various components such as the covered porch, stairwell, entry, laundry, and cold room. The roof features ridge venting at a ratio of 1/300, with a ceiling slope extending into the great room. The storage area is unconditioned, with dimensions of 48\" x 42\" and a span of 16'-0\". The section details the use of 1/4\" T&G screwed and glued to the truss bottom chord. The foundation includes compacted granular 'A' and backfill with parent material. Key dimensions include a grade of 4'-2\", a total height of 9'-1\", and specific room heights such as 6'-9 11/32\" and 8'-0 1/2\". The section also highlights the use of minimum 4\" polyurethane and compliance with OBC for stairs and handrails. Vented soffits and morvents are part of the roof assembly, ensuring proper ventilation. The section provides a detailed view of the building's structural and architectural elements, emphasizing the relationship between different components and their dimensions.",
