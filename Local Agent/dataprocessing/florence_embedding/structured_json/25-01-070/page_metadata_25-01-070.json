      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a mixed set of drawings and notes for a floating slab foundation. It includes a plan view of the floating slab with dimensions of 26' x 30', and a section view showing the thickened edge detail. The general notes cover foundation preparation, concrete specifications, and construction requirements. Key components include the floating slab and thickened edge, with detailed instructions for concrete work and slab installation."
