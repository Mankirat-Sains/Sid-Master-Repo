Key components include a sill plate with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48 inches on center, and openings left at door locations. The section shows (4) 15M continuous rebar, with notes for cover specifications. The slab includes options for reinforcement with 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh, a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh. A 6 mil polyethylene vapor barrier is optional, and the base consists of compacted granular 'A'. The section indicates a slope grade away at 2% and insulation if present.",
