      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a detailed plan and section for a floating slab foundation, including a thickened edge and pad footings. The plan view shows the layout and dimensions of the slab, while the section view details the construction of the thickened edge. General notes cover important construction requirements, such as concrete specifications, rebar spacing, and slab construction guidelines. The sheet is essential for ensuring proper foundation construction and includes specific instructions for review and verification before pouring concrete."
