The section, labeled '2/S1', shows a sill plate with ½\"Ø anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center, with openings left at door locations. The slab is reinforced with (4) 15M rebar, and options for reinforcement include 6x6x½ WWM or a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid or fiber mesh. A 6mil poly vapor barrier is optional, and the foundation includes compacted granular 'A' and a minimum of 2\" (R10) extruded polystyrene insulation. The slope grade is away from the structure at 2%.
