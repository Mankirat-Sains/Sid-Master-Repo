Key components include a sill plate with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48 inches on center, continuous 15M rebar, and a 6 mil poly vapour barrier. The section also specifies the use of 6x6x6 welded wire mesh or a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid or fibre mesh for reinforcement. The foundation is built on compacted granular 'A' material, and the grade is sloped away at 2% with optional insulation. The section callout '2/S1' connects this view to the plan, providing a detailed understanding of the foundation's edge design.",
