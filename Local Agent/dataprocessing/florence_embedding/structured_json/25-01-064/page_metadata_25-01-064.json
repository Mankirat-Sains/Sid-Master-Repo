SLAB MUST BE CARRIED DOWN TO NATURAL UNDISTURBED SOIL CAPABLE OF SUSTAINING 1500 PSF (75 kPa) PRESSURE UNDER PART OR 3000 PSF (150 kPa) UNDER STRUCTURAL LOADS. ALLOWABLE BEARING PRESSURE IS FOR SLS.\n3. IF GRADE TO BE BUILT UP, GRANULAR 'B' FILL IS TO BE USED TO A COMPACTION MAXIMUM OF 95% SPMDD. COMPACTION TO BE OBSERVED BY GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER.\n4. IF FILL IS USED, A SOIL ENGINEER MUST PROVIDE CERTIFICATION OF ADEQUATE FOUNDATION BEARING SURFACE.\n5. LINE SEWER TRENCHING, IF NOT INSTALLED, CLIENT CONTRACTOR ACCEPTS THE POTENTIAL OF CRACKING/HEAVING OVER TIME (IF BUILDING IS NOT HEATED) OR HEAT LOSS (IF BUILDING IS HEATED).\n6. IF BUILDING NOT HEATED, CLIENT CONTRACTOR ACCEPTS THE POTENTIAL OF CRACKING/HEAVING OVER TIME.\n7. SLAB IS ON FROST. BRICK VENEER MAY BE USED UP TO MAXIMUM OF 4' OF ABOVE SLAB. CLIENT CONTRACTOR TO CONFIRM SLAB DIMENSIONS BEFORE ORDERING MATERIAL & CONSTRUCTION.\nCONCRETE:\n1. ALL CONCRETE ON THIS PROJECT SHALL HAVE A MINIMUM OF 20 MPa COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH AT 28 DAYS, 6% AIR ENTRAINMENT AND 0.40 MAX WATER/CEMENT RATIO.\n2. ALL REINFORCEMENT TO BE GRADE 400W.\n3. REBAR SPLICE LENGTH: 30 x BAR LAP\n4. WELDED WIRE MESH: 1 x LAP\n5. ALL CONCRETE WORK SHALL BE CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE TO THE LATEST EDITION OF THE ONTARIO BUILDING CODE, CAN/CSA-A23.1-23.2 AND LOCAL BY-LAWS.\n6. CONCRETE WORK SHALL BE CARRIED OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH:\n   a) WHERE CONCRETE IS IN CONTACT WITH EARTH (i.e. FOOTINGS)\n   b) WHERE CONCRETE IS IN CONTACT WITH EARTH (i.e. SIDE OF THE FLOATING SLAB)\n   c) SLAB ON GRADE, SLAB ON FILL OR GRANULAR 'A' FILL COMPACTED TO 95% SPMDD ON COMPACTED GRANULAR 'A'.\n7. SLAB SURFACE TO A TROWEL OR BROOM FINISH.\n8. SLAB IS NOT TO RECEIVE ANY FROZEN GROUND.\n9. SLAB IS TO BE POURED MONOLITHICALLY, ONE TIME.\n10. SLIP JOINTS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL UTILITY CONNECTIONS.\nREVIEW OF FLOATING SLABS:\nIF REVIEW OR SIGN-OFF OF THE FLOATING SLAB IS REQUIRED, PROVIDE PHOTOS...",
      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a detailed overview of the floating slab foundation, including a plan and section view. It includes general notes on foundation preparation, concrete specifications, and construction requirements. The plan shows the layout of the slab, while the section details the thickened edge design. Key components include the floating slab and thickened edge, with specific instructions for concrete work and site preparation. The sheet is essential for ensuring proper foundation construction and compliance with engineering standards."
