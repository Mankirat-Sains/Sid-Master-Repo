It details the continuous 2x6 X-bracing fastened to the top side of the bottom chord, with installation required on all trusses. Lateral bracing is to be as per the truss manufacturer's engineer, with details shown on pre-engineered truss shop drawings. Prefinished metal fascia, eavestrough, and vented soffit are specified per owner requirements. Continuous ridge venting is to be installed per Ontario Building Code and manufacturer specifications. Truss uplift clips are required at each end, and a double top plate is continuous. The section specifies a pressure-treated sill plate with a sill gasket and 1/2-inch diameter anchor bolts at 48 inches on center, with openings left at door locations. Concrete foundations are to bear on undisturbed native soil or compacted fill approved by a geotechnical engineer. Key components include trusses, concrete foundations, and wall strapping.",
