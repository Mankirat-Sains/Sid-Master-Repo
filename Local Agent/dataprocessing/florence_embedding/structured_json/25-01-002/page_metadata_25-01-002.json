      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a detailed plan and sections for a floating slab foundation, including thickened edge details. It includes comprehensive general notes on preparation, concrete specifications, and reinforcement requirements. The plan view shows the overall dimensions of the slab as 40'-0\" by 30'-0\". The sections illustrate the construction details, including reinforcement and insulation. The sheet emphasizes the importance of proper preparation and inspection to prevent issues such as cracking or heaving."
