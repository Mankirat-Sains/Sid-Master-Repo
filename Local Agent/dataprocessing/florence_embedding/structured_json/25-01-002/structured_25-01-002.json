      "summary": "This section view illustrates a thickened edge detail for a foundation with a 12-inch curb option. The sill plate is secured with 1/2-inch diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48 inches on center, with openings left at door locations. An 8-inch poured concrete curb is reinforced with 15M rebar, 20 inches long, spaced at 32 inches on center, and includes one continuous 15M rebar at the top. Openings are also left in the curb at door locations. The section includes four 15M rebar, with notes for cover specifications. Reinforcement options include 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh (WWM), a 16-inch by 16-inch 10M grid, or fiber mesh. The grade is sloped away at 2%, with optional insulation. A 6-mil poly vapor barrier is optional, and the base consists of compacted granular 'A'. A minimum of 2 inches (R10) of extruded polystyrene with a compressive strength of 30 psi is specified. Dimensions include a 6-foot length, 2-inch thickness, and 1-foot height.",
