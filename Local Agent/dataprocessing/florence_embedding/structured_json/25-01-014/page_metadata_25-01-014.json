      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a comprehensive overview of the foundation design for a floating slab, including detailed notes on foundation preparation, concrete specifications, and reinforcement requirements. It includes a plan view of the floating slab layout and sections detailing the thickened edges and intermediate strip footings. The general notes emphasize the importance of proper soil preparation and concrete placement to ensure structural integrity. The sheet also outlines review procedures for the floating slab construction, highlighting the need for photographic documentation before concrete pouring."
