The sill plate is secured with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48 inches on center, with openings left at door locations. The foundation includes four 15M rebar bars, with cover specifications noted elsewhere. The slab reinforcement options include 6x6x6 welded wire mesh (WWM), a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fiber mesh. A 6 mil poly vapor barrier is optional, and the base consists of compacted granular 'A'. The section also specifies a minimum of 2 inches (R10) of extruded polystyrene with a compressive strength of 30 psi. Dimensions include a 6-foot width, a 2-inch thickened edge, and a 1-foot depth.",
