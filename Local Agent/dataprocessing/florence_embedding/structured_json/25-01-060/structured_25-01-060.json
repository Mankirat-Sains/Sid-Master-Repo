Conventional framing members (sizes and connections) and any other elements or components (non-truss items) have not been included in this review. No site inspection will be made by Alpine Systems. Loading was specified by others to be verified by the Project Engineer or the Authority Having Jurisdiction prior to fabrication. Truss conforms to NBCC2020, BCBC 2024, NBC-2023 Alberta Edition, 2024 MBC, and OBC 2024. Review applies to the above project, and only to the trusses referenced on the index sheet.\nTruss Fabricator Scope of Work: Fabrication of trusses according to the individual truss designs as derived from the building plans as approved for span, spacing, quantities, and truss profile.\nProject Engineer and Truss Installer Scope of Work: All roof and/or floor truss bracing (overall building bracing) if not specifically designed by the Project Engineer shall conform to generally accepted empirical guidelines of \"BCSI – Building Component Safety Information\".\nScope of Work\nWhen signed and sealed, the scope of work of Alpine Systems Corporation is limited to the design of individual metal plate connected wood truss components based on the loading, spacing, geometry and bearing locations shown on this drawing.\nThe overall building design and project design specifications, non-truss component design, truss support, bearing or anchorage design, truss permanent bracing design and anchorage, truss fabrication review, and truss site installation review are specifically outside of Alpine’s scope of work.",
      "summary": "This section contains detailed notes regarding the truss placement plan for the roof. It includes the job number 258931-2 and location at 790 Glasgow, Kitchener ON. The disclaimer by Alpine Systems Corporation outlines their scope of work, which involves reviewing truss designs for appropriate loads, bearing locations, and truss-to-truss load transfers. The truss designs conform to various building codes such as NBCC2020 and OBC 2024. The truss fabricator is responsible for fabricating trusses according to approved designs, while the project engineer and installer must ensure truss bracing conforms to BCSI guidelines. Alpine Systems' scope is limited to designing individual truss components, excluding overall building design and non-truss components. This information is crucial for ensuring compliance with safety standards and proper installation of the truss system.",
