      "summary": "This detail illustrates the footing insulation for the David Bauman House Addition. The drawing specifies that the interior slab is to be 5 inches above the top of the footing, with 2 inches of rigid foam insulation between the footing and the slab. The basement wall is constructed according to plans by others. The section view shows the grade line and indicates the use of a 2-layer, 2-inch thick polystyrene (S.M.) that is 4 feet wide below grade to provide frost protection at the footings. This detail ensures proper thermal insulation and structural support at the foundation level.",
