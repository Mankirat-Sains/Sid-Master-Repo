A 3/8\" thick steel end plate is welded to the beam with a 1/4\" fillet weld. Behind the frame, a shear wall is specified to have 1/2\" plywood fastened with 2 3/8\" nails at 4 inches on center along panel edges and 12 inches in the field under drywall. The bottom plate is anchored through the floor with 1/2\" epoxy anchors at 24 inches on center, with a minimum 4-inch embedment into the stone wall below. The contractor is instructed to confirm the stone wall's solid bearing condition or pour a 25MPa concrete cap mix to fill and roughen, removing any loose material and applying a bonding agent before pouring. The drawing is certified by a professional engineer.",
