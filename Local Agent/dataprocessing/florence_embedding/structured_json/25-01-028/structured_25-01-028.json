      "summary": "This section view illustrates the thickened edge of a floating slab foundation. The section is labeled '2/S1' and is drawn at a scale of 1/2\"=1'-0\". Key components include a sill plate with 1/2\" diameter anchor bolts spaced at 48 inches on center, and four 15M rebar for reinforcement. The section specifies a slope grade away at 2% and optional insulation. The foundation includes a 6mil poly vapour barrier and a minimum of 2 inches of extruded polystyrene with a compressive strength of 30 psi. Compacted granular 'A' is used as a base, and the slab reinforcement options include 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh or a 16\" x 16\" 10M grid or fibre mesh. The section provides detailed construction specifications for the thickened edge of the slab.",
