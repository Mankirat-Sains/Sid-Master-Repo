      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a detailed overview of the floating slab foundation design, including a plan and section view. It includes general notes on foundation preparation, concrete specifications, and construction requirements. The drawing specifies the dimensions and reinforcement details for the slab, as well as guidelines for installation and inspection. The sheet is essential for ensuring proper foundation construction and includes critical notes on potential issues such as cracking and heating requirements."
