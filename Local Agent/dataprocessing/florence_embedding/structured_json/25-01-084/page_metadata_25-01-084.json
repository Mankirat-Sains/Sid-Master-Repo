      "page_overview_summary": "This sheet provides a detailed plan and sections for a floating slab foundation, including thickened edges and thermal breaks. The general notes cover foundational requirements, concrete specifications, and construction guidelines. The plan view shows dimensions of the slab, while sections illustrate specific construction details such as rebar placement and insulation. The drawing is intended for a foundation level and includes critical notes for ensuring structural integrity and compliance with building codes."
