The bracing consists of 2x4 struts, each 5'-0\" long, attached at the top and bottom with two 3 1/2\" nails at each truss web member. Diagonal braces are anchored to the lateral with four 3 1/2\" nails at the intersection of the truss web and truss lateral. The spacing of the 2x4 diagonal bracing is determined by the bracing designer. The detail emphasizes the importance of tight butt joints at all splice locations and the need for the diagonal brace to extend fully from the top chord to the bottom chord of the truss. The section callout '2/S5' refers to this specific detail.",

      "summary": "This combined detail shows both a pier and base plate assembly. The pier detail (BP1) includes a 12\" x 12\" x 3/4\" base plate bolted to a 20\" diameter concrete pier with (4) 3/4\" x 16\" anchor bolts. The pier is reinforced with (4) 15M vertical bars and 10M ties at 10 inches on center, with a double top tie. The base plate detail (BP2) is 8\" x 12\" x 3/4\" with similar reinforcement. Additional components include a steel angle (L 4\" x 3\" x 3/8\" x 6\") and a moment connection with (2) M20 bolts. The section callouts '1/S9' and '2/S9' reference sheet S9. The drawing scale is 1/2\" = 1'-0\".",
