      "summary": "This detail drawing shows a flattened view of a step bracket from the rear. The bracket includes several dimensions: 1/8\", 5\", 11\", and 11 5/16\". It features 1/2\" and 9/16\" square holes with R1/8\" fillets all around. The note 'USE .DXF OR .DWG FILE FOR EXACT PATTERN' indicates that precise digital files should be used for manufacturing. The text 'DOWN 90° R 1/8\"' suggests a bending detail. The drawing is intended for precise fabrication of the bracket, which is part of a project for D.C. Racking.",

The bracket is part of a project for D.C. Racking and is intended for precise manufacturing. The drawing complements the flattened view by providing a spatial understanding of the bracket's geometry.",
