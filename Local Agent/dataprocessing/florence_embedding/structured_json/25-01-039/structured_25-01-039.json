Key components include concrete lintels (CL1, CL2), columns (C1, C1a, C2), footings (PF1, PF2, PF3), and floor assemblies (FL1, FL3). The notes specify requirements for fasteners, lintel reinforcement, ICF opening reinforcement, and frost protection for footings. The floor assemblies detail concrete basement floors and deck systems. The ICF wall assemblies outline tie spacing, wall height, and rebar placement. The footing schedule provides dimensions and reinforcement details for concrete pad footings. The concrete lintel schedule specifies load capacities and reinforcement requirements. The column schedule details steel jackposts and stud posts. The concrete pier schedule includes footing tube dimensions and anchor requirements. The framed wall assemblies describe bearing and partition walls with drywall and stud specifications. The beam and ledger schedules provide details for deck beams and ledgers.
