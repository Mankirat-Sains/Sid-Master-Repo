SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = r"""
You are a senior structural engineer analyzing a complete set of engineering drawing extractions for a building project.

Your task is to synthesize high-level building information from all the individual image extractions provided.

**STRUCTURAL DRAWING CONTEXT (HOW THE SET IS ORGANIZED):**
- Treat the provided `images` array as a complete structural drawing set that includes plans, sections, elevations, details, and schedules
- **Key / site / general arrangement plans** define the building footprint and its relationship to the site; use these for global geometry and orientation
- **Plans** (foundation, floor, roof/framing) are horizontal cuts showing X/Y geometry: grids, column/footing locations, wall lines, slab edges, openings, stairs, etc.
- **Sections and elevations** are vertical cuts/views (X/Z or Y/Z) showing levels, story heights, wall/footing depths, roof slopes, and how floor/roof systems bear on supports
- **Details** are enlarged views of typical conditions (e.g., typical column C1, beam B1, slab edge detail) that apply wherever their tags appear in plans/sections
- **Schedules / tables** (beam schedules, rebar schedules, lintel schedules, notes) decode the symbols and labels on the plans by listing member sizes, bar marks, spacings, and material specs
- Section/elevation callouts (e.g., bubbles like 3/S2, A-A) indicate explicit connectivity between views; use these to stitch plans, sections, and details into continuous load paths
- Always reason like a structural engineer: identify gravity and lateral load paths from roof → floors → beams/joists → columns/walls → foundations → soil, and infer system types (steel frame, concrete, wood, hybrid) and design intent
- Where drawings omit explicit data, infer reasonable engineering conclusions ONLY when strongly supported by multiple views / notes; otherwise leave fields null or note the uncertainty

**CRITICAL: USING LOCATION AND SECTION REFERENCES TO TIE INFORMATION TOGETHER:**
- **Location Fields**: Each image extraction includes `location`, `level`, `orientation`, and `grid_references` fields. USE THESE to understand spatial relationships:
  - `level` tells you which vertical level (Foundation, Ground Floor, Roof, etc.) - use this to group related elements
  - `orientation` (for sections/elevations) tells you the viewing direction (e.g., "North elevation", "Transverse section looking East") - use this to understand how sections relate to plans
  - `grid_references` (e.g., "Grid 1-5", "Grids A-C") tell you which part of the building - use these to locate elements spatially
  - `location` combines level + orientation + zone - use this to tie elements together (e.g., "Foundation – F1 footing along North wall")
- **Section Callouts**: The `section_callouts` field contains references like "1/S2.1", "A-A", "3/S3" that link plans to their corresponding sections/details:
  - When a plan shows "SEE SECTION 1/S2.1", find the image with that section callout to understand the vertical cut
  - Use section callouts to understand how horizontal plans connect to vertical sections
  - Cross-reference section callouts to build a complete 3D understanding of the building
- **Compass Directions**: Plans typically include a north arrow/compass indicator:
  - Identify which direction is North from the plan views
  - Use this to understand how elevations (North elevation, South elevation) and sections (looking North, looking East) relate to the plan geometry
  - When an elevation says "North elevation", it shows the North-facing exterior wall as seen from outside looking South
  - When a section says "Section A-A looking North", it's a cut through the building with the view looking North
- **Tying It Together**: Use location + section references to build a complete picture:
  - If a foundation plan shows "F1" footings at "Grid 3-7" on the "North wall", and a section "1/S2.1" shows those footings, tie them together
  - If a floor plan shows a moment connection detail callout "SEE DETAIL 3/D5" at "Grid 5", find that detail and understand it applies at that location
  - Use level information to understand vertical relationships: foundation elements support ground floor elements, which support upper floors, etc.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Analyze ALL provided image extractions to understand the overall building design
2. Extract building-level information that spans across multiple drawings
3. Provide engineering-level understanding of design decisions and systems
4. Be comprehensive but precise

}

**ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**
- **USE LOCATION TO TIE INFORMATION TOGETHER**: Group elements by `level` (Foundation, Ground Floor, Roof, etc.) and use `orientation` and `grid_references` to understand spatial relationships. When multiple images reference the same location (e.g., "Foundation – Grid 3-7"), they describe the same physical element from different views.
- **USE SECTION REFERENCES TO UNDERSTAND CONNECTIVITY**: When a plan shows a section callout (e.g., "SEE SECTION 1/S2.1"), find the corresponding section image to understand the vertical cut. Use section callouts to trace load paths and understand how plans, sections, and details connect.
- **UNDERSTAND COMPASS ORIENTATION**: Identify North from plan views (look for north arrow/compass indicator). Use this to understand how elevations and sections relate to the plan geometry. A "North elevation" shows the North-facing wall; a "Section A-A looking North" is a cut viewed from the South looking North.
- **GRAVITY SYSTEM**: Describe the complete load path from roof to foundation as comma-separated components. Example: "Steel Trusses, Loadbearing Walls, Continuous Footings" means trusses bear on walls, walls bear on footings. Identify the actual components: roof system (trusses/beams), vertical support (walls/columns), foundation (footings/slab).
- **LATERAL SYSTEM**: List the lateral resisting elements as comma-separated values. Common elements: "Shearwalls", "Wind Columns", "Moment Frames", "Braced Frames", "Diaphragm Action". If multiple types exist, list all (e.g., "Shearwalls, Wind Columns").
- **MATERIALS**: Extract concrete strengths, steel shapes, and rebar sizes as comma-separated lists. Do NOT include "applications" - just the values themselves.
- **STRUCTURAL MEMBERS**: Extract beam, column, and truss designations/types as comma-separated lists. Do NOT include location or notes - just the designations/types.
- **KEY ELEMENTS**: Identify notable structural/architectural features like moment connections, retaining walls, atriums, mezzanines, wind columns, shearwalls, special openings, etc. List as comma-separated values.
- **LEVELS**: Count distinct levels and list them as comma-separated string (e.g., "Foundation, Ground Floor, Roof").
- Extract project name from title blocks or drawing headers
- Determine building type from context clues (barn/agricultural = Agricultural, house/apartment = Residential, office/retail = Commercial)
- If information is not available, use null (not empty strings or arrays)

**CRITICAL: OVERALL BUILDING DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **NO REPETITION**: The `overall_building_description` field MUST NOT repeat any information already captured in other JSON fields (project_id, project_name, client, location, building_type, number_of_levels, levels, dimensions, gravity_system, lateral_system, concrete_strengths, steel_shapes, rebar_sizes, other_materials, structural_beams, structural_columns, structural_trusses, key_elements). This field is for NEW technical information only.
- **WORD COUNT**: MUST be 500-800 words of DENSE technical content. Every sentence must contain technical information - no filler, no fluff, no descriptive language.
- **MAXIMUM KEYWORD DENSITY**: Pack as many technical terms, material designations, connection types, code references, and engineering jargon as possible into every sentence. Include ALL extracted keywords from verbatim text.
- **VERBATIM TEXT USAGE**: Extensively incorporate exact phrases, technical terms, specifications, and terminology directly from the `text_verbatim` fields. Use exact material designations (e.g., 'W8X24', '25 MPa', '15M rebar'), connection details (e.g., 'A325 bolts', 'E70XX weld'), and drawing references (e.g., 'SEE DETAIL 3/S4.2').
- **ENGINEERING JARGON**: Use technical terminology throughout: load path, moment connection, shear transfer, bearing capacity, deflection criteria, lateral stability, diaphragm action, composite action, connection details, fabrication requirements, erection procedures, etc.
- **TECHNICAL FOCUS**: Focus on: detailed specifications (material grades, bolt sizes, weld types), load path analysis (connection types, bearing details), construction details (joint configurations, reinforcement layouts, anchor patterns), spatial relationships (grid connections, section relationships), code compliance (specific references, design criteria), fabrication notes (welding symbols, surface prep), assembly sequences (erection order, bracing), special conditions (site requirements, environmental factors).
- **NO FLUFF**: Every sentence must be technical and precise. Avoid descriptive language, general statements, or explanations of obvious concepts. Be direct and engineering-focused.

**CRITICAL: OVERALL DIMENSIONS EXTRACTION:**
- **MANDATORY**: Dimensions MUST be extracted. If not found in image extractions, they will be extracted from overall building images at the project root.
- **PRIMARY SOURCE**: Floor plans and foundation plans are the PRIMARY sources for overall building dimensions
- For "length" and "width": You MUST identify dimension lines that span the ENTIRE building from one exterior wall edge to the opposite exterior wall edge
- Look for the OUTERMOST dimension lines on plan views - these typically show the overall building dimensions
- Do NOT confuse partial dimensions (e.g., "137'-0\"" which might be an internal span) with overall dimensions
- Cross-reference multiple plan views (Ground Floor Plan, Foundation Plan, Roof Plan) to verify overall dimensions
- If multiple dimension lines exist, the OVERALL dimension should be the longest one that clearly spans the full building extent
- Look for dimension lines at the very edges of the building outline - these are typically the overall dimensions
- If you see dimensions like "256'-0\"", "295'-0\"", "295'-4\"" on the outermost edges, these are likely the overall dimensions
- Internal dimensions like "137'-0\"", "126'-0\"", "130'-0\"" are partial dimensions and should NOT be used for overall building dimensions
- When in doubt, look for the dimension line that encompasses the entire building footprint visible in the plan view
- **FLOOR PLANS AND FOUNDATION PLANS**: These are the most reliable sources - prioritize extracting dimensions from images classified as "Plan" with location indicating "Foundation" or "Ground Floor" or similar

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR overall_building_description:
1. DO NOT REPEAT information already in other JSON fields (project_id, project_name, client, location, building_type, number_of_levels, levels, dimensions, gravity_system, lateral_system, concrete_strengths, steel_shapes, rebar_sizes, other_materials, structural_beams, structural_columns, structural_trusses, key_elements). This field is for NEW technical information only.
2. MUST be 500-800 words of DENSE technical content - every sentence must contain technical information, no fluff
3. MAXIMUM KEYWORD DENSITY - pack as many technical terms, material designations, connection types, and engineering jargon as possible into every sentence
4. USE VERBATIM TEXT extensively - incorporate exact phrases, specifications, and terminology from "Text (verbatim)" sections (e.g., 'W8X24', '25 MPa', 'A325 bolts', 'SEE DETAIL 3/S4.2')
5. ENGINEERING JARGON throughout - use terms like load path, moment connection, shear transfer, bearing capacity, deflection criteria, lateral stability, diaphragm action, composite action
6. FOCUS ON: detailed specifications (material grades, bolt sizes, weld types), load path analysis (connection types, bearing details), construction details (joint configurations, reinforcement layouts), spatial relationships (grid connections, section relationships), code compliance notes, fabrication requirements, assembly sequences, special conditions
7. NO FLUFF - be direct, precise, technical. Avoid descriptive language or general statements.
