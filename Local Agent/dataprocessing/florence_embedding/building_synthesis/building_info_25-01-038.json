  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the Roy Whittaker House Renovation project involves a comprehensive integration of pre-engineered wood trusses and loadbearing walls, ensuring effective load transfer from the roof to the foundation. The roof system employs pre-engineered trusses, including scissor trusses and girder trusses, which are spaced at 24 inches on center, providing lateral stability and supporting the roof's diaphragm action. The trusses are detailed with pre-finished metal waterproofing membranes and 1/2-inch roofing plywood secured with 'H' clips, with an alternative option of 5/8-inch T&G OSB sheathing or 1x4 strapping at 24 inches on center. The roof assemblies, identified as R1 and R2, are reinforced with 2x4 truss bracing as required, ensuring compliance with deflection criteria and performance standards. The foundation system comprises insulated concrete form (ICF) wall assemblies and concrete piers, with specific callouts such as ICF1 and P1, P3, providing robust support for the existing floor system. The concrete piers are detailed with Simpson base saddles and Hilti Kwik anchors, ensuring secure connections to the beams above. The use of 2 - 1/2-inch diameter x 3 1/2-inch A307 lag screws, totaling four, and 2 - 15M reinforcing bars into the footing, with a 2-inch concrete cover, ensures the structural integrity of the piers. The foundation plan also includes a beam schedule with W8x18 steel beams and built-up beams using pressure-treated lumber, such as (2) 2x10 and (3) 2x10 configurations, providing adequate support for the floor joists and loadbearing walls. The main floor plan incorporates floor assemblies FL2 and FL3, with the former featuring 3/4-inch T&G sheathing screwed and glued, and the latter comprising 5/4 pressure-treated decking screwed to deck joists. Wall assemblies EW1 and EW2 are constructed with 2x6 studs at 16 inches on center, R22 batt insulation, and 1/2-inch drywall, ensuring thermal efficiency and structural resilience. The deck ledger detail, identified as 2/D1, illustrates the connection of the deck to the existing exterior wall and floor system, with screws specified per plan, ensuring proper shear transfer and load distribution. The building section, oriented longitudinally, highlights the integration of the existing roof structure with the new truss system, maintaining continuity and lateral stability. The section also details the screened deck and existing crawl space, with vented soffits providing necessary ventilation. The elevations, including front, rear, left, and right views, emphasize the aesthetic integration of vinyl siding and metal roofing, with lintels over existing openings as per the Ontario Building Code (OBC). The roof slope is consistently indicated with a 6:12 pitch, ensuring effective water drainage and compliance with design criteria. The project specifications require pre-engineered truss drawings to be submitted to the building department prior to site inspection, with truss layouts verified for dimensions and suitability before manufacture. The construction details, including joint configurations, reinforcement layouts, and anchor bolt patterns, are meticulously outlined to ensure adherence to building standards and structural performance requirements. The assembly sequences prioritize the erection of loadbearing walls and trusses, with temporary bracing as needed to maintain stability during construction. The design also considers site-specific requirements, such as minimum 4-foot cover to concrete pier footings, ensuring compliance with environmental and geotechnical conditions. Overall, the renovation project integrates advanced structural systems and materials, ensuring a robust and compliant residential building."
