  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the 60' x 100' shed addition incorporates a robust framework of pre-engineered trusses, which are aligned with wood stud walls below, ensuring a seamless load path from the roof to the foundation. The trusses are designed by others and require submission of P. Eng. stamped shop drawings for review, ensuring compliance with the specified design criteria. Uplift clips are mandated per the truss manufacturer's design, and trusses are toe-nailed to the top plate with 3-inch nails, supplemented by uplift clips for enhanced stability. The roof system includes 2x6 ladder framing at 16 inches on center and 2x4 blocking nailed to strapping with 3-inch Ardox nails, ensuring lateral stability and diaphragm action. The foundation system comprises 8-inch concrete walls reinforced with 15M verticals at 36 inches on center and horizontal reinforcement at the top, mid-height, and grade. The continuous concrete strip footing, measuring 24 inches by 8 inches, is reinforced with two 15M continuous bars, designed to bear on undisturbed native soil or compacted fill approved by a geotechnical engineer. The overhead door lintel section features a steel beam secured with 1/2-inch bolts staggered at 24 inches on center, accommodating pre-engineered roof trusses and truss uplift clips per manufacturer drawings. Bolt requirements vary based on beam size, with specifications provided for W8 to W24 beams, ensuring adequate shear transfer and bearing capacity. The shearwall detail specifies 1/2-inch plywood on both sides, fastened with 2-3/8-inch nail-gun nails at 4 inches on center at panel edges and 12 inches on center in the field, with blocking at 24 inches on center and all panel edges. The 3-ply stud post at each end of the shearwall is secured to an L5x3x1/4-inch angle LVL with a 5/8-inch diameter by 8-inch long hooked anchor into the concrete foundation wall, ensuring lateral stability and deflection criteria compliance. The roof truss framing plan highlights continuous 2x6 bracing fastened directly to the top side of the truss bottom chord, with installation required on all trusses as per the truss manufacturer's engineer. The assembly schedule outlines typical roof construction with 29 Ga. steel roofing and 2x4 strapping at 24 inches on center, while the slab on grade construction includes a 6-inch concrete floor slab over 6-inch compacted granular 'A' fill. Exterior wall construction involves 29 Ga. prefinished metal cladding, a Typar air barrier with taped joints, and options for 2x8 wood studs at 24 inches on center or 2x6 wood studs at 16 inches on center, with solid blocking at 48 inches on center. The building elevations depict the use of prefinished metal cladding and roofing, with sliding doors measuring 20 feet by 16 feet in height, enhancing accessibility and functionality. The design adheres to Ontario Building Code requirements, with continuous ridge venting installed as per manufacturer specifications, ensuring adequate ventilation and performance. The construction details emphasize precise joint configurations, reinforcement layouts, and anchor bolt patterns, with specific attention to spatial relationships and grid line connections, ensuring a cohesive and structurally sound addition to the existing building."
