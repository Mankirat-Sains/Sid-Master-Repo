  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the 2-storey garage integrates a comprehensive load path analysis, ensuring efficient load transfer from the roof to the foundation. The roof system employs engineered scissor trusses spaced at 24 inches on center, providing robust support for the asphalt shingle roofing and 1/2-inch spruce plywood sheathing. These trusses are secured with hurricane ties, enhancing lateral stability against wind loads. The load path continues through the 2x6 stud walls, spaced at 24 inches on center, which are sheathed with 1/2-inch plywood and clad in vinyl siding. The walls are anchored to the foundation with 1/2-inch diameter anchor bolts at 48 inches on center, ensuring a secure connection to the engineered slab foundation. The foundation itself is reinforced with 15M rebar, providing a minimum 3-inch cover, and includes a thickened slab at post locations measuring 2'-6\" x 2'-6\". The typical edge detail specifies the use of 6x6 6 GA welded wire fabric or a 16\" x 16\" x 10M grid, with a 6 mil poly vapour barrier and 2 inches of extruded polystyrene insulation with a minimum compressive strength of 30 PSI. The main floor plan incorporates a W12x45 steel beam and LVL 2.0E beams, supported by 6x6 pressure-treated columns set in 19-inch diameter concrete columns. The floor system features 5/8-inch tongue and groove floor sheathing, glued and nailed to 2x10 floor joists at 16 inches on center, with 2x2 'X' bridging at midspan for added rigidity. The mezzanine level is supported by engineered attic trusses, also spaced at 24 inches on center, with floor sheathing attached to the bottom chord of the trusses. The garage's elevations highlight the use of vinyl siding and the inclusion of windows and garage doors, with the front elevation featuring three windows and two garage doors. The right elevation includes a staircase leading to a platform with a 42-inch high guardrail, compliant with SB-7 O.B.C. standards. The wall sheathing rating schedule, Table 9.23.16.2.B., provides guidance on maximum support spacing and panel marks, ensuring compliance with CAN/CSA-0325.0 standards. The construction details emphasize the use of a foam sill gasket and a 2x6 sill plate, providing a continuous thermal break and moisture barrier at the base of the walls. The assembly sequence prioritizes the installation of the engineered slab, followed by the erection of the wall framing and roof trusses, with temporary bracing as required to maintain structural integrity during construction. The design adheres to relevant building codes and standards, ensuring a safe and durable structure capable of withstanding environmental loads and providing long-term performance."
