  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the 75' x 256' Poultry Barn integrates a robust framework of pre-engineered trusses, meticulously aligned with wood stud walls to ensure optimal load distribution. The trusses, designed by external engineers, require submission of P.Eng. stamped shop drawings for review, ensuring compliance with structural integrity standards. The truss system incorporates uplift clips and toe nails, with specific fastening details such as (4) 3\" nails per truss, enhancing the connection to the top plate. The roof system is further stabilized by 2x4 diagonal 'X' braces and 2x6 ladder framing, with precise nail sizes and spacing specified to maintain structural stability. The foundation system comprises 8\" concrete walls reinforced with 15M vertical rebar at 48\" o.c., and horizontal rebar at critical points, ensuring adequate shear resistance. The foundation walls are anchored to a continuous 24\" x 8\" strip footing, reinforced with two 15M bars, providing a stable base on undisturbed native soil or compacted fill, as verified by a geotechnical engineer. Wind columns are embedded with a 6\"x14\"x1/2\" steel plate, secured by 3/8\" thru bolts, and supported by a 3'-0\" x 3'-0\" x 12\" thick footing, reinforced with 15M rebar, to withstand lateral forces. The shearwall system employs plywood sheathing fastened with 2-3/8\" nailgun nails at 4\" o.c. along panel edges, with solid blocking at 24\" o.c., ensuring lateral stability. Overhead door lintels incorporate steel beams with end plates secured by A325 bolts, with bolt requirements varying by beam size, ensuring adequate load transfer. The roof truss framing plan specifies fastening details for gable end trusses, including 3-1/2\" nails at 16\" o.c., and attic fire stops with 1/2\" GWB, ensuring compliance with OBC requirements. Purlin splices are reinforced with 4'-0\" long 26 ga. metal tracks, secured with 16 nails per splice, ensuring continuity across the roof structure. The building's exterior features prefinished metal cladding and roofing, with a concrete foundation providing structural support. The design incorporates proposed ventilation systems, as detailed in the building sections, ensuring compliance with environmental and operational requirements. The assembly sequences emphasize coordination with truss suppliers and adherence to CSA standards for wood treatment, ensuring durability and performance in various environmental conditions. The integration of these elements results in a structurally sound and efficient agricultural facility, capable of withstanding both gravity and lateral loads while meeting the functional requirements of a poultry barn."
