  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the 14-unit stacked townhouse at 768 Arlington St. incorporates a robust combination of engineered roof trusses and shearwalls to ensure both gravity and lateral load resistance. The roof system utilizes GAF-Timberline fiberglass/asphalt shingles over 7/16\" OSB sheathing, secured with 'H' clips on pre-engineered roof trusses spaced at 24\" o.c., providing a durable and weather-resistant covering. The trusses are anchored using uplift clips as per manufacturer specifications, with toe-nailing to the top plate using four 3\" nails per truss, ensuring stability against uplift forces. The lateral stability is further enhanced by the installation of diagonal bracing on all truss web members, with 2x4 struts anchored using 3-1/2\" nails, providing resistance against wind and seismic loads. The exterior walls are constructed with 2x6 wood stud framing at 16\" o.c., insulated with R22 fiberglass batt insulation, and clad with prefinished horizontal siding over a 1\" R5 rigid insulation layer, ensuring thermal efficiency and moisture protection. The foundation system comprises 12\" thick concrete walls with a compressive strength of 25 MPa, reinforced with 15M vertical and horizontal rebar at 24\" o.c., providing a solid base for the structure. The foundation is supported by 24\" wide x 8\" deep concrete strip footings, reinforced with continuous 15M rebar, ensuring adequate load transfer to the soil. The basement level features hollow-core slabs, providing a lightweight yet strong flooring system capable of spanning large distances without intermediate supports. The shearwalls, constructed with 7/16\" OSB sheathing and 3-ply stud posts, are anchored to the foundation using 5/8\" diameter threaded rods with Hilti HIT-HY 200-v adhesive, ensuring a secure connection capable of resisting lateral forces. The building's fire safety is enhanced by the inclusion of 1-hour and 2-hour fire-rated walls, constructed with Type X gypsum board and Roxall 'Cavity Rock' mineral wool insulation, providing both fire resistance and sound attenuation. The balcony systems are designed with solid precast slabs, featuring a 3/4\" diameter continuous drip edge and supported by pressure-treated wood beams, ensuring durability and resistance to environmental exposure. The balconies are connected to the main structure using reinforced concrete lintels and dowels epoxied into the foundation, providing a secure and stable connection. The design adheres to the Ontario Building Code requirements, with specific attention to rainwater discharge, exterior lighting, and window safety, ensuring compliance with local regulations. The construction process involves precise coordination of truss layout, shearwall placement, and foundation preparation, with detailed shop drawings required for all pre-engineered components to ensure accuracy and structural integrity. The use of prefabricated elements, such as hollow-core slabs and precast balconies, facilitates efficient construction while maintaining high-quality standards. The building's design incorporates sustainable practices, with the use of spray foam insulation as a radon barrier and rigid insulation for thermal efficiency, contributing to the overall energy performance of the structure."
