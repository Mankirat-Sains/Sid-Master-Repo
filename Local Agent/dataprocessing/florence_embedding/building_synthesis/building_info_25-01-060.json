  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the 790 Glassgow Street Addition & Renovation project incorporates a comprehensive load path analysis, ensuring efficient load transfer from the roof to the foundation. The pre-engineered roof trusses are designed to distribute loads to the loadbearing walls, which in turn transfer the loads to the concrete footings. The trusses are specified to conform to NBCC2020 and OBC 2024 standards, ensuring compliance with current building codes. Each truss is detailed with specific load transfer mechanisms, including truss-to-truss connections and bearing locations, verified by the truss engineer of record, Alpine Systems Corporation. The truss placement plan requires P.Eng approved drawings to be presented at the framing inspection, ensuring adherence to design specifications. The lateral stability of the structure is achieved through shearwalls and braced frames, providing resistance against wind and seismic forces. The foundation plan specifies new footings to be integrated with the existing foundation, bearing on undisturbed native soil or compacted fill as approved by a geotechnical engineer. The foundation detail includes isolation slip joints between piers and adjacent slabs to accommodate differential movement. The wall section detail illustrates the use of steel beams secured with 1/2\" bolts at 24\" on center, with truss uplift clips as per manufacturer drawings, ensuring robust connections. The wall assembly includes R50 polyurethane foam insulation for thermal efficiency, with window openings wrapped in Blueskin for moisture protection. The sidewalk and ramp slab detail specifies 15M dowels at 24\" on center for reinforcement, with rigid insulation extending beyond the slab edge for thermal continuity. The entry section detail incorporates a waterstop and bond break to prevent moisture ingress and allow for slab movement. The timber brace detail specifies GRK screws for secure connections, ensuring structural integrity. The accessible ensuite layout includes slip-resistant flooring and grab bars, designed to meet accessibility standards. The venting schedule outlines top and bottom venting provisions, ensuring adequate ventilation throughout the building. The window schedule specifies energy-efficient casement windows with a maximum U-value of 0.28, tailored to owner preferences. The general notes emphasize compliance with the Ontario Building Code and the importance of verifying all dimensions prior to construction. The project incorporates a comprehensive approach to structural design, ensuring safety, compliance, and functionality."
