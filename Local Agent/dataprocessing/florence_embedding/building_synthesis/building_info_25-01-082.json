  "overall_building_description": "The lifting lug detail for the Headon Reservoir project, as designed by Waddell Engineering Ltd. and BGL Contractors Corp., is engineered to handle a maximum lifted load of 5 kN, specifically for check valve applications. The design adheres to ASME BTH-1-2005 and ASME B30.20 standards, classified under Category B with a design factor Nd of 3.0, ensuring compliance with rigorous lifting safety criteria. The lug is fabricated from ASTM A36 mild steel, a material known for its excellent weldability and strength, which is further enhanced by hot-dip galvanization post-fabrication to prevent corrosion. The lug's main hole diameter is Ø64 mm, accommodating minimum 50.0 mm diameter shackle pins, crucial for maintaining vertical lift integrity. The lug is anchored to a 712 mm concrete beam using a 19 mm threaded rod, embedded a minimum of 125 mm with Hilti HY200 adhesive, ensuring robust load transfer and anchorage. The design mandates 100% magnetic particle inspection (MPI) of all welds, conforming to CSA W59 standards, with visual inspection and testing as per CWB requirements, ensuring weld integrity and safety. The lifting operation requires two assemblies, each capable of supporting the 457 kg check valve weight, with rigging responsibilities assigned to external contractors. The design emphasizes precise alignment of the lifting lugs on the shackle pin to prevent lateral load imbalances. The detailed specifications include joint configurations, such as the Ø22 mm typical holes, and the overall lug thickness of 19 mm, which are critical for maintaining structural integrity under load. The assembly sequence involves careful coordination of the lifting lugs and shackle pins, ensuring that the provisions for centering on the shackle pin are met to prevent eccentric loading. The spatial relationship between the lug and the concrete beam is defined by the anchorage system, which is critical for transferring the load safely to the structural support. The design also considers environmental factors, such as corrosion resistance, achieved through galvanization, which is essential for outdoor applications. The project specifications highlight the importance of adherence to industry standards and rigorous inspection protocols to ensure safety and performance in lifting operations. The use of Hilti HY200 for anchorage demonstrates a commitment to using high-performance materials for critical load-bearing applications. The detailed engineering approach ensures that all components work in unison to provide a reliable and safe lifting solution for the Headon Reservoir project."
