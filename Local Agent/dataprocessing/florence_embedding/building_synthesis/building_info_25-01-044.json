  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the 45'-0\" x 100'-0\" farm building is characterized by a robust integration of pre-engineered trusses and shearwall systems, ensuring both gravity and lateral load resistance. The roof system employs pre-engineered trusses spaced at 48 inches on center, directly aligned with the wood stud walls below, facilitating efficient load transfer. These trusses are supported by HSS steel columns, which are detailed with post-to-beam connections using 3/8-inch thick endplates and 3/4-inch A325 bolts, ensuring secure load paths from the roof to the foundation. The roof features a 4/12 pitch with metal cladding, providing both structural integrity and weather resistance. Lateral stability is achieved through a combination of shearwalls and lateral 'X' braces. The shearwalls are constructed with 7/16-inch OSB sheathing, fastened with 2 3/8-inch nails at 4 inches on center along panel edges, and reinforced with 3-ply stud posts at each end. These shearwalls are anchored to an 8-inch concrete foundation wall using 5/8-inch anchor bolts embedded 8 inches into the concrete, ensuring a rigid lateral force resisting system. The lateral 'X' braces, composed of 2x4 struts and diagonal braces, are strategically placed to enhance the truss system's stability, with connections detailed using 3 1/2-inch nails. The foundation system consists of a floating slab, reinforced with 6x6x6/6 welded wire mesh and 15M rebar, providing a stable base for the structure. The slab is designed with a 6-inch thickness and a compressive strength of 32 MPa, ensuring adequate support for the building loads. The slab edge details incorporate 2-inch rigid insulation and a 6 mil poly vapour barrier, optimizing thermal performance and moisture protection. The main floor plan includes a mezzanine supported by steel posts and baseplates, with floor drains strategically placed and connected to a water/oil separator. The building's elevations feature metal wall cladding and overhead doors, with dimensions meticulously detailed to ensure precise construction. The construction details emphasize the use of high-strength materials and precise connection techniques, such as the use of A325 bolts and lag screws for securing steel beams over doors. The design adheres to the latest edition of the National Building Code, with specific attention to concrete work, reinforcement layouts, and insulation requirements as per the Canadian Foundation Engineering Manual. The assembly sequence is carefully planned, with erection procedures and temporary bracing requirements outlined to ensure safe and efficient construction. The building's design also considers site-specific conditions, such as subgrade preparation for a 1500 P.S.F safe bearing capacity and the potential for frost susceptibility, ensuring long-term structural performance."
