  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of Forbes’ Residence involves a comprehensive integration of existing and proposed elements to achieve a cohesive structural system. The basement level features a sonotube foundation system, where timber columns are supported by concrete piers and footings, ensuring load transfer to undisturbed native soil or compacted fill as approved by a geotechnical engineer. The sonotube detail specifies the use of approved Simpson post bases, with timber column sizes and concrete pier reinforcing detailed in the structural plans. The basement structural plan outlines areas designated as unexcavated and crawl spaces, with mechanical and laundry rooms included in the layout. The plan emphasizes the importance of reporting any construction discrepancies to the designer before proceeding. The proposed rear wood deck is supported by 4\"x4\" posts fastened to 10\" concrete piers using Simpson post bases, specifically ABA44Z anchored with 1/2\" diameter bolts. The deck structure includes 2\"x12\" PT stringers and 2\"x8\" PT deck joists spaced at 16 inches on center, with a 2\"x8\" PT ledger fastened to the existing concrete wall using 1/2\" diameter wedge anchors. The deck plan specifies the use of (2) 1.75\" x 11.875\" LVL beams, emphasizing the need for fastening beams to posts with EPC42 connectors. The first floor structural plan retains existing floor joists, beams, and roof trusses, while proposing a wood deck with railings compliant with SB-10 standards. The plan includes section callouts 2/A04, 3/A04, and 1/A04, indicating connections to other sheets. The attachment of a 2\"x9 1/2\" LVL to the girder truss bottom is specified, with built-up studs at each end. The deck detail illustrates the connection of a wood deck to the existing structure, featuring a continuous 38x140 top rail with 38x38 pickets secured by 76mm screws. Joist hangers support the structure, and a wood beam with plywood filler and gussets is connected using 16mm screws or metal post beam connectors. The wood post is anchored to a concrete pier, poured a minimum of 1200mm below grade on undisturbed soil. The detail specifies maximum joist spans and connections to the existing floor structure, including a double ledger lag bolted to the foundation wall with 12.7mm diameter bolts spaced at 800mm on center. The deck detail emphasizes the use of 89x89 support posts spaced at 1200mm on center, with stringers anchored to precast concrete using 9.5mm diameter thru bolts. The minimum stringer depth is 285mm, with a continuous 50x100 guard required. The beam detail specifies the nailing of two 9 1/2\" LVLs to the existing girder truss using three 3 1/4\" common nails spaced at 8 inches on center. The general notes highlight the pressure-treated ratings for various components, including decking, ledger boards, joists, beams, and stair stringers. All exterior LVL beams must be wrapped against moisture, and the contractor is required to verify all assumed joist directions and the location of all beams and columns on-site, reporting any discrepancies to the designer before proceeding. The elevations provide a comprehensive view of the residence, detailing the exterior with proposed changes, including wood railings and pressure-treated wood decks. The elevations include multiple levels, with the top of the existing roof at 6.17 meters and the basement at -1.47 meters. Proposed wood railings are to comply with SB10, as referenced in TACBOC details 3/S02. The structure includes a 4\"x4\" post fastened to a 10\" concrete pier, with specifications for a Simpson post base. The elevations show window and door placements, and the overall building height is clearly depicted."
