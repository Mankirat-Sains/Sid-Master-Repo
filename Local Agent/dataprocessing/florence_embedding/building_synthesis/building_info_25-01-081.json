  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the residential building at 296 Alderview Drive incorporates a comprehensive load path strategy, utilizing steel beams as primary horizontal load-bearing elements, supported by wood stud walls configured at 16 inches on center. The integration of Type X drywall and R-20 Rockwool insulation within the wall assemblies ensures compliance with fire resistance and thermal performance criteria. The use of 6mil vapour barriers across new wall installations mitigates moisture ingress, maintaining the integrity of the building envelope. The wall schedule delineates multiple wall types, including W1, a new wall assembly featuring 5/8-inch Type X drywall and 2x4 wood studs, and W3, an existing wall with 2x6 wood studs and exterior sheathing, providing structural continuity and lateral stability. The proposed ground floor plan highlights the strategic placement of steel beams to support key areas such as the garage, dining room, and living room, ensuring effective load distribution and structural resilience. The second floor plan introduces additional living spaces, including an upper loft TV room and a sun deck, supported by the existing structural framework. The wall detail section specifies the installation of brick veneer supported by a steel angle, with a peel & stick membrane transition strip enhancing the air barrier system. Lag bolts with a 3-inch embedment into the wood lintel are specified at 30 inches on center, ensuring robust connection and load transfer. Weep holes with mesh screens are incorporated at 32 inches on center to facilitate moisture drainage, while a prefinished metal drip edge provides additional protection against water ingress. Lintel installation notes emphasize the importance of shoring during brick installation and for seven days post-completion, ensuring structural stability during the curing process. The use of 3-1/2-inch clay brick with horizontal ladder reinforcement in the first five courses above the lintel enhances the structural integrity of the masonry assembly. The solid course extending 12 inches past the door jamb, utilizing Type S mortar, provides additional lateral support and load distribution. The detailed specifications and construction notes ensure compliance with relevant building codes and standards, facilitating a robust and durable structural system. The integration of these elements within the overall design framework underscores the emphasis on structural performance, durability, and compliance with engineering best practices."
