  "overall_building_description": "The structural design of the building incorporates a comprehensive load path strategy, ensuring efficient transfer of loads from the roof to the foundation. The roof system utilizes pre-engineered trusses, including scissor, attic, and common trusses, spaced at 24 inches on center. These trusses are supported by loadbearing walls constructed with 2x6 studs at 16 inches on center, providing both vertical and lateral stability. The walls are sheathed with 7/16 inch OSB, fastened with 2 3/8 inch nail-gun nails at 6 inches on center along panel edges and 10 inches on center in the field, ensuring adequate shear transfer. Simpson HUBD-SDS2.5 holdown anchors with 7/8 inch diameter rods and Hilti HIT HY 200 MAX epoxy are employed at each end of the shearwalls, providing a minimum embedment of 12 inches into the foundation. The foundation system consists of continuous footings, constructed with 25 MPA poured concrete, reinforced with 15M rebar. The footings are designed to accommodate foundation footing steps with a maximum step height of 2 feet and a minimum run of 4 feet, ensuring a minimum cover of 4 feet to all footings. The foundation walls are insulated with 2x6 rigid insulation, extending a minimum of 24 inches below grade, and are anchored with 1/2 inch diameter anchor bolts at 48 inches on center. The building envelope features vinyl siding and metal roofing, providing durable exterior finishes. The roof assembly includes vented soffits and ridge venting at a ratio of 1/300, ensuring adequate ventilation and moisture control. The interior ceiling assemblies are insulated with R50 cellulose, supported by 1x3 strapping at 16 inches on center, and finished with 1/2 inch drywall, taped and sanded. The building's fire-resistance strategy includes 1-hour and 2-hour fire-resistance rated assemblies, utilizing multiple layers of 5/8 inch type 'X' gypsum board, ensuring compliance with NFPA 80 and OBC standards. The firewall detail between the main floor and shop incorporates fire caulk and acoustical sealant, with electrical boxes tightly fitted and offset from opposite side stud cavities. The timber column detail specifies the use of Simpson Base ABU1010RZ with Hilti Kwik anchors, ensuring secure attachment to the foundation. The porch column to slab connection utilizes a Simpson Base ABU88RZ, with 10M rebar anchoring the slab to the wall at 24 inches on center, providing a minimum 3-inch slab edge bearing. The building section reveals a longitudinal cut through the structure, highlighting spatial relationships and transitions between different levels and components. The section emphasizes the integration of architectural and structural elements, such as the covered porch, stairwell, and cold room, with precise dimensions and material specifications. The assembly schedule provides a detailed overview of construction methods and materials, ensuring compliance with building codes and standards. Overall, the building's design reflects a meticulous approach to structural integrity, fire safety, and environmental control, with a focus on durability, efficiency, and compliance with regulatory requirements."
