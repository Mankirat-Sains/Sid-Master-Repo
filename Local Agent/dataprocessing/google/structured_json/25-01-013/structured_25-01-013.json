      "summary": "This is a hand-drawn second-floor plan view, indicated by the title \"SECOND FLOOR\" and \"NOT TO SCALE\". The plan depicts the layout of rooms including a washroom, closet, and bedroom, along with dimensions for various spaces. Notable dimensions include a 12'5\" width for a section of the washroom, a 9'10\" dimension for another part of the washroom area, and a 14'10\" dimension for the bedroom. The plan also shows a staircase with a \"Down\" label and a 10'8\" dimension associated with it. Red annotations highlight \"EXISTING CEILING JOIST\" in two locations, suggesting the presence of existing structural elements above or integrated into the framing. A critical note states \"TRUSSES ARE FULL SPAN TO EXTERIOR WALLS\", indicating the roof framing system spans directly to the exterior walls, implying a specific roof structure design. The overall layout suggests a residential or similar building floor plan with distinct room divisions and circulation paths.",

The new beam is specified as a dropped beam and requires a minimum of three 1.75\" x 14\" LVL 2.0E 3100fb members. The plan also shows the placement of minimum (3) PLY 2X6 stud posts to support structural loads. Several dimensions are noted, including 11'10\", 12'11\", and 14'6\" for beam length and room dimensions. Annotations prompt confirmation regarding the depth of the installed beam and what is located below an installed post, specifically questioning if it is a 6\" concrete block wall and if its cores are grouted solid. Existing floor joists are also indicated. The drawing is marked 'NOT TO SCALE'.",
