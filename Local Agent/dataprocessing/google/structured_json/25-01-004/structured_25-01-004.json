The plan shows a central horizontal line, likely representing a ridge or valley, with diagonal lines indicating rafters or framing members. Circular callouts labeled '1', '2', '3', '4', and '5' are distributed across the plan, likely referencing specific framing elements, connections, or details that are further defined in accompanying notes or schedules. The notation '4/12' appears twice, indicating a roof slope of 4 units vertical to 12 units horizontal, which is a common pitch for roofs. Arrows associated with callouts '3', '4', and '5' suggest directions of forces, slopes, or structural support. The presence of 'ROOF NOTES:' indicates that further critical information is provided elsewhere.",
