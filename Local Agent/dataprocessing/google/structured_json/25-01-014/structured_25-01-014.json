The foundation includes a footing with a minimum width of 1'-0\" and a depth of 2\" below the slab, supporting a slab that is 6\" thick. The slab has a thickened edge extending downwards. The detail specifies (4) 15M rebar for reinforcement within the slab, with a note to refer to other notes for cover requirements. The sill plate is secured with \\\"Ø anchor bolts spaced at 48\" on center, with provisions to leave openings for doors. The exterior grade slopes away at 2% and may include insulation. Beneath the slab, a 6mil poly vapour barrier is optional, laid over compacted granular 'A' fill. A minimum of 2\" (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation with a minimum compressive strength of 30 psi is specified below the slab. Reinforcement options for the slab include 6x6x% WWM, 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fibre mesh. The overall scale of the detail is 1/2\"=1'-0\". The section callouts '2/S1' and '3/S' indicate this detail is part of a larger drawing set and references other sections or sheets.",
