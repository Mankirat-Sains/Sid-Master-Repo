      "summary": "This image is a South Elevation showing the framing for a \"Tall Wall\" section of the building. The elevation depicts the exterior wall construction, including wood stud framing, window openings, and various siding materials. Key vertical dimensions are indicated, such as the top of the foundation (T/O FDN.) at 9'-7 3/8\" and the top of the proposed second floor (T/O SUBFLR.) at 3'-6 1/8\" above the existing main subfloor. The framing includes multiple \"1 JACK + 1 KING\" configurations around window openings, indicating a common method for supporting headers. The note \"ADD OR ENSURE STUDS ARE 2x6 @ 16\" o.c. MAX.\" specifies the stud spacing and size for the wall. The drawing also references existing timber columns and a timber girt. Exterior finishes are detailed, including \"GENTEK VINYL FAIRWEATHER VERTICAL SIDING\", \"GENTEK ALUMINUM ALIGN HORIZONTAL SIDING\", \"FALSE TIMBER HEADERS\", and \"GENTEK VINYL TRIM WORK\". The roof is noted as \"EXIST. STEEL ROOF TO REMAIN\" and finished with \"ASPHALT SHINGLES\". Stone column bases are shown at the foundation level. The scale is provided as 1/4\" = 1'-0\".",

It lists three types of glazing units, specified by \"ID/SIZE\" as \"3'-0\" x 3'-0\", \"3'-0\" x 4'-0\", and \"3'-0\" x 6'-0\". For each size, the quantity (QUAN.) is 2, with corresponding \"GLAZING AREA (sf)\" of 8.00, 10.80, and 16.60 respectively. The \"TOTAL OPENING AREA (sf)\" for these units are 16.00, 21.60, and 33.20. Below this, a \"SPATIAL CALCULATION\" section provides key metrics. The \"WALL AREA (sf)\" is calculated as 504.40, which is equivalent to 46.86 \"WALL AREA (sm)\". A \"LIMITING DISTANCE (M)\" of 8.7 is noted. The \"MAXIMUM GLAZING ALLOWED (\"%)\" is 100%, corresponding to a maximum allowed area of 504.40 \"sf\". The \"TOTAL GLAZING AREA PROVIDED (sf)\" is 70.80, which constitutes 14.04% of the total wall area. This schedule is crucial for understanding the fenestration strategy and compliance with building code requirements for the south elevation.",

The detail is presented in two views: SECTION A-A, a cross-section, and SECTION A-A (ISO), an isometric view for clarity. The double sill is noted to be \"AS PER WALL SCHEDULE\". The first ply of the sill is fastened with 1/2\" diameter lag screws, requiring a minimum embedment of 3 1/2\" into timber at 24\" on center, with staggered placement. The second ply is fastened with 3 1/4\" nailgun nails at 2\" on center, with the number of nails varying based on lumber size (e.g., 3 nails for 2x6, 4 nails for 2x8). These nails are spaced at 12\" on center along the sill. An existing timber girt is shown, and a steel member labeled \"C9x13.4\" is also depicted. \"STRAPPING AS PER WALL SCHEDULE\" indicates additional bracing elements are detailed elsewhere. The detail highlights the connection of timber framing elements and the specific fastening requirements for constructing the sill and wall assembly.",
