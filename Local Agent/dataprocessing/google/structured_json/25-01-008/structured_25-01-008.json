The gate assembly itself appears to be a large circular gate, likely a slide gate or similar mechanism, with a corrugated metal pipe (CMP) component labeled \"1200mm-CMP_68-13-2\". The accompanying text provides critical performance and installation notes. It states that the gate and seal design exceeds AWWA C561-14 performance criteria, with leakage well below the allowed 1.25 l/min/m of sealing perimeter. The design heads (seating, unseating, and operating) are all specified as 5m, with the possibility of higher head designs. Installation notes emphasize that the frame assembly, pedestal, wall brace, and stem components must be installed flat, straight, and plumb, with shimming and bracing as needed. The overall assembly is designed and FEA tested to meet strength and leakage standards according to AWWA C561-14.",

The opening itself is framed by a steel structure with a diameter of 52.5 inches (1334 mm) at its outer edge, and the overall depth of the assembly is indicated as 48.5 inches (1232 mm). A smaller dimension of 7.688 inches (195 mm) is shown, possibly representing the thickness of an adjacent structural element or a component within the sliding mechanism. Another dimension of 2 inches (51 mm) is noted, likely indicating a clearance or a specific component thickness. The detail illustrates the integration of a large circular opening with a sliding system, suggesting a functional component within a larger structure, such as a large gate, hatch, or access point. The use of both imperial and metric units in the annotations aids in precise interpretation.",
