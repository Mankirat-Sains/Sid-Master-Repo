Key features include angled edges at the top with angles of 49.5° and 40.5°, and a central hole with a diameter of 3 1/2\" for a shackle pin. The drawing also indicates a smaller hole with a 2\" diameter near the base. A table indicates a maximum lifting capacity of 17 tons, which is also noted as needing to be clearly labeled on the device. General parameters state that lifting lugs are designed for vertical lifts only and that the shackle pin used is 3\" in diameter. The material specification for structural steel conforms to S16-09, and all steel is to be new and painted as specified by the owner. The drawing also notes that a lifting beam is not shown for clarity and that a plate cut-out is to be salvaged for alternate use.",
