The slab has a thickness of approximately 6 inches, indicated by the dimension line and the placement of reinforcement. It is reinforced with (3) 15M rebar bars at the top and (3) 15M rebar bars at the bottom, with additional reinforcement specified as either 6\"x6\"x% WWM (welded wire mesh) or 10M grid at 10\" on center. The footing appears to be approximately 1'-6\" wide and 2\" deep, resting on compacted granular 'A' fill. A minimum of 2 inches of extruded polystyrene insulation (R10) with a minimum compressive strength of 30 psi is placed below the slab, protected by a 6 mil poly vapor barrier. The drawing also indicates a 2% slope away from the load-bearing edge for grade and insulation, if present. Anchoring details are provided, specifying Hilti Kwik Bolt 3 wedge anchors with a minimum 4\" embedment or Hilti carbon steel threaded rod with Hilti HIT-HY 200 safe set system, also with a minimum 4\" embedment, or equivalent anchors. The diameter and projection of these anchors are to be as per steel drawings. The section callout '4/S1' indicates this is section 4 on sheet S1, and the scale is 1/2\" = 1'-0\".",
