The plan details two types of floor construction: a 'TYPICAL GARAGE FLOOR' consisting of a 4\" concrete slab with 32 MPa concrete and a 6\" layer of 3/4\" washed stone, and a 'TYPICAL BASEMENT FLOOR' also with a 4\" concrete slab but using 25 MPa concrete and a 6\" layer of 3/4\" washed stone, with an option for 2\" rigid insulation if floor heating is present. Foundation walls are designated as 'FW:1' and 'FW:2', and various footings are labeled 'F:2', 'F:3', and a '14\" DEEP FOOTING' for a masonry chimney. The plan also shows interior divisions for a 'COLD CELLAR' and a 'BEDROOM 1', with specific floor finishes noted such as '3/4\" STONE FLOOR' in the cold cellar. The walls in the garage area are noted to 'STEP UP AS GRADE ALLOWS'. Several section callouts (e.g., 'A/28', 'B/28', 'C/28', 'D/29') are visible, indicating where sections are taken through this plan.

The Wall Schedule details two types of exterior walls (FW:1 and FW:2) and two interior wall types (W:2 and W:3). FW:1 describes an exterior wall with vinyl siding, a water barrier, 2.5\" rigid insulation on both sides of a 6\" concrete core, 6 mil poly, and 1/2\" drywall. FW:2 specifies an 8\" poured-in-place foundation wall with 25 MPa strength, a 7\"x20\" continuous strip footing, and reinforcement consisting of 15M vertical rebar spaced at 4'-0\" on center, with one run of 15M rebar in the top of the wall. Interior wall types W:2 and W:3 are standard wood-framed walls with 1/2\" drywall on both sides, 2x4 studs at 16\" on center, and R12 batt insulation for W:3. The Footing Schedule lists dimensions for various footings: F:1 is 30\"x30\"x10\"; F:2 is a larger 48\"x48\"x12\" footing reinforced with four 15M bars each way; and F:3 is a 12\"x12\" pier resting on a 30\"x30\"x10\" footing. The Column Schedule (C:1) defines a 3\"x3\" steel post rated for a minimum factored load of 41,000 lbs and an unfactored load of 29,000 lbs. Finally, the Beam Schedule (B:1) indicates a W200x31 steel beam. These schedules provide critical design information for the construction of the building's structural elements.",

W:1 and W:4 are exterior walls with vinyl siding, an air barrier, 1\" rigid insulation, 7/16\" OSB, 2x6 studs at 16\" O.C., R-20 batts, 6 mil poly, and 1/2\" drywall. W:2 is a typical interior wall with 1/2\" drywall on both sides of 2x4 studs at 16\" O.C. W:3 is another interior wall type with 1/2\" drywall, 2x4 studs at 16\" O.C., R-12 batts, and 1/2\" drywall. The column schedule lists six types (C:1 to C:6). C:1 is a 3\"x3\" steel post rated for a minimum 24,000 lbs factored load and 17,000 lbs unfactored load. C:2 is a 10\"x10\" #2 Fir post. C:3 through C:6 are glulam columns composed of multiple 2x4 or 2x6 members. The beam schedule includes B:1, a W 10x33 or W 8x48 steel beam, and B:2, a 10\"x12\" #2 Doug Fir beam, designated for roof beams. A professional engineer's stamp from S.

W:1 is a vinyl-sided exterior wall with a 1\" rigid insulation layer, 7/16\" OSB sheathing, 2x6 studs at 16\" O.C., R-20 batt insulation, 6 mil poly vapor barrier, and 1/2\" drywall. W:2 is a typical interior wall with 1/2\" drywall on both sides of 2x4 studs at 16\" O.C. W:3 is a similar interior wall but with R-12 batt insulation. W:4 is another exterior wall type with vinyl siding, 7/16\" OSB, 2x6 studs at 16\" O.C., and optional R-20 insulation, poly, and drywall. W:5 is an exterior wall featuring 1\" R-6 rigid insulation, 7/16\" OSB, 2x6 studs at 16\" O.C., R-20 batt insulation, 6 mil poly, and 1/2\" drywall. The column schedule specifies a C:2 column as a 10\"x10\" #2 Douglas Fir. The beam schedule indicates a B:2 beam as a 10x12 Douglas Fir member. The drawing also shows a circular callout with '28' inside, likely a sheet or drawing number reference.",

The provided text indicates that the finish floor is supported by a 5/8 inch tongue-and-groove plywood subfloor, which is attached to the wood I-joists with screws and glue. This detail is crucial for understanding the load path from the finished floor surface down to the supporting joists and ultimately to the structure below. The plan shows a complex arrangement of joists, suggesting varying spans and potentially different loading conditions across the floor area. The dotted lines may represent elements from adjacent levels or structural components not directly part of the first-floor framing itself, such as foundation walls or upper-level framing.",
