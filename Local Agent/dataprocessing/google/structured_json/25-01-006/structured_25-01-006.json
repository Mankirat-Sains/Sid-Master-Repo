      "summary": "This detail illustrates the bracing and connection methods for pre-engineered roof trusses. The drawing shows how trusses are to be aligned with the studs below and toe-nailed to the top plate using (4) 3-inch nails per truss, in addition to uplift clips specified by the truss manufacturer or engineer. It details the application of 2x4 diagonal 'X' bracing on the opposite side of the truss at endwalls and other specified locations, anchored with (2) 3-1/2-inch nails at each truss. The detail also shows 2x4 struts, 5'-0\" long, at the top and bottom chords, fastened with (2) 3-1/2-inch nails to each truss web member. For gable end trusses, specific fastening methods are outlined, including connections to top plates at 10\" o.c. with 3-1/2-inch nails, or to through studs with (3) 3-1/2-inch nails, or to posts with (6) 4-inch nails for post walls. The \"Roof Truss Bracing Notes\" provide critical information for the contractor, emphasizing the need to notify the manufacturer of any truss deficiencies and detailing requirements for diagonal bracing on web members, X-bracing at endwalls, and permanent lateral bracing. Note 4 specifies that diagonal bracing is required at all discontinuities in lateral bracing, and the truss supplier shall design trusses for the bracing noted, with details not to be modified unless specified by the building designer. The detail also indicates that strapping or sheathing on the roof deck should be spaced as specified by the truss engineer, using 2x4 lumber. Blocking is shown as 2x4 lumber nailed to strapping with (5) 3-inch Ardox nails at each end, typically spaced at 8'-0\" o.c. maximum. Where overhangs exceed 1'-4\", a drop end truss of 5.5\" is specified, along with 2x6 overhang framing cantilevered, and 2x6 ladder framing at 16\" o.c. The detail highlights the importance of proper alignment and secure fastening of all bracing elements to ensure the structural integrity of the roof system.",

The exterior of the foundation wall is shown backfilled with parent material, with a grade sloping away from the building. A minimum of 4'-0\" of exterior wall is indicated above grade. Below the foundation wall is a 24-inch wide by 8-inch deep continuous concrete strip footing, reinforced with two continuous 15M bars. The footing is specified to bear on undisturbed native soil or compacted fill approved by a geotechnical engineer. The detail also shows 2\" rigid insulation (R-10 minimum) extending 24\" below grade, as required by code. 15M dowels, 24\" long with 6\" embedment, are shown connecting the foundation wall to the footing at spacing to suit the vertical rebar. A concrete slab, as per plan, is shown adjacent to the foundation wall, resting on a layer of 2\" rigid insulation. Metal flashing is indicated as per client specifications.",

The wind column, identified as a C6x8.2 channel, is shown to be embedded within a thickened concrete wall section, increasing from a standard thickness to 14 inches at the column location. The roof truss connection to the column involves a 6\"x14\"x1/2\" steel plate secured with six 3/8\" thru bolts, with a note indicating the use of carriage bolts or plate washers. The column itself is anchored to a 3'-0\" x 3'-0\" x 12\" thick footing via a 14\" x (column depth + 1/2\") x 3/4\" thick baseplate, which is secured with two 5/8\" diameter sleeve anchors having 6\" embedment. The detail also shows a 1/2\" cap plate with four 1/2\" diameter A325 bolts at the top of the column. Reinforcement from a continuous strip footing is shown to extend through the column footing. The drawing specifies that foundations are to bear on undisturbed native soil or compacted fill approved by a geotechnical engineer. A \"TOP DETAIL\" inset illustrates the connection of the C6x8.2 channel to the embedded steel wind column, showing double top plates and a 1/4\" plate connection with two 1/2\" diameter bolts.

      "summary": "This section view details an overhead door lintel assembly, incorporating a steel beam and a built-up wood post. The steel beam, the size of which is indicated to be found on the plan, supports pre-engineered roof trusses, with uplift clips specified as per the truss manufacturer's drawings. A double top plate is continuous. A 3/8\" end plate connects to the steel beam, with bolt requirements specified based on beam size: W8-W10 beams use 4 x 1/2\" dia. A325 thru-bolts, W12-W14 use 6 bolts, W16-W18 use 8 bolts, W21 use 10 bolts, and W24 use 12 bolts. Sub-framing below the steel beam, designed to suit typical stud size and spacing, includes continuous 2x6 or 2x8 members at the head of the opening. The framing also specifies bearing studs, full height studs, and typical stud framing as per the plan. For door hardware fastening, 2x12 members are provided at the top of the opening and 2x6 members along the sides, requiring coordination with the door manufacturer. Studs are fastened together per the CWC Wood Design Manual, with stud post to plate connections secured by two nails per stud from the bottom run of strapping. A key component is the built-up wood post, detailed to be secured to a L5x3x1/4\" angle with eight 5/16\" dia. x 3\" lag screws. This angle is further secured with a 5/8\" dia. x 8\" long hooked anchor into the concrete below. The detail includes dimensions for the wood post assembly, showing a 1 1/2\" width for the angle and 1 1/4\" spacing for the lag screws, with a 1\" typical spacing for other elements. The overall scale of the section is 1/2\" = 1'-0\".",

The Lintel Schedule lists four lintels (L1 through L4) with their sizes and bearing details. For example, L1 is composed of (2)-2x6 lumber and requires a bearing of (1) JACK + (1) KING. L4 is a W10x26 steel beam with a \"NAILER\" designation, requiring a bearing of (2) JACK + (2) KING. The Column Schedule identifies one column, C1, as a W6x25 steel section, with baseplate and anchor details to be \"AS PER DETAIL\". Below the schedules, a section on P.T. Ratings defines various treatment levels (CSA UC1 to CSA UC4.1) based on exposure conditions, ranging from indoor, dry conditions (UC1) to outdoor wood in contact with ground or freshwater (UC4.1). A concluding note advises that members in unconditioned spaces may be left untreated, but this could affect wood condition and aesthetics over time. This information is critical for selecting appropriate materials and ensuring durability based on their intended use and environmental exposure.",

The trusses are indicated to be designed by others and are spaced at 48 inches on center, aligning directly above studs. The plan specifies the installation of X-bracing on all trusses, with lateral bracing to be designed by the truss engineer and installed per truss shop drawings. Overlay trusses are shown at 32 inches on center in one area. Dimensions such as 96'-2 1/4\", 96'-0\", and 63'-11 1/4\" define the overall building dimensions and bay sizes. Notes detail the requirement for attic fire stops using 1/2\" OSB or 2x3 framing, ensuring continuous support for all joints and limiting compartment dimensions to 98'-4\". A critical detail involves making adjacent ridge (top) and eave (bottom) purlins continuous by providing 4'-0\" long 26 gauge track at each splice location. This track is to be fastened with (16) 1 1/2\" N10HDG (10d) nails on each side of the splice, as referenced in Detail 1/S4.0. This detail is typical for each side of the roof, and roof vents should be avoided. Additionally, the plan specifies fastening gable end trusses to the top plate with 3-1/2\" nails at 10\" on center, or to each through stud with (3) 3-1/2\" nails, which is typical for both gable ends. The scale of the drawing is 1\" = 10'-0\".",
