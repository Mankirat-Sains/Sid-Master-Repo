The foundation consists of a footing topped with a minimum of 6 inches of compacted Granular 'A' fill on undisturbed soil. Above this, a gravel floor is indicated. The walls are constructed with PT posts and 2x4 strapping at 24\" o.c., with a board and batten finish. The roof structure features engineered roof trusses spaced at 48\" o.c., with 2x4 roof strapping at 22\" o.c. The roof deck is 3/8\" plywood, and 2x10 joists are spaced at 16\" o.c. Purlins are continuous, with adjacent purlins at the ridge and eave on each roof plane. A detail (D5) shows a typical purlin splice using 22 ga. track and 1 1/2\" nails. Uplift scabs, consisting of two 2x6 PT boards 18\" long, are specified at the top of the wall, secured with either 8 or 10 4\" galvanized spiral nails per scab, depending on the location shown. The section also notes the requirement for x-bracing as per engineers' truss drawing review and that the contractor must provide stamped truss drawings. Lateral bracing on webs is as per the truss plan. Ridge vents are to be provided as per OBC (by others). The overall height from the top of the footing to the top of the roof is approximately 9'-9\".",

It shows how 2x4 lumber is used for diagonal bracing, struts, and laterals. The bracing is specified to be spaced as required by the bracing designer, with a maximum spacing of 48'-0\". Struts are 5'-0\" long and are attached to truss web members with two 3\\\" nails at the top and bottom. Diagonal braces are anchored to laterals with four 3\\\" nails at the intersection of the truss web and lateral. Diagonal braces are also anchored to struts at both ends with four 3\\\" nails. Laterals are butted at all splice locations, ensuring a tight, centered joint on the truss web. The detail also shows that diagonal bracing should lap a minimum of two trusses to extend completely from the top chord to the bottom chord. The components shown are typical wood framing elements including truss top chords, truss web members, and truss bottom chords.",

      "summary": "This detail, labeled D6, illustrates the diagonal bracing system for trusses. The primary components are 2x4 lumber used for diagonal braces, struts, and laterals, all fastened with nails. The detail specifies various connection methods, including 'X' bracing on opposite sides of trusses at endwalls, anchoring diagonal braces to laterals with four 3 1/2\" nails, and using 2x4 struts (5'-0\" long) at the top and bottom chords, secured with two 3 1/2\" nails to each truss web member. Butt joints for 2x4 laterals at splice locations are detailed, emphasizing a tight, centered fit on the truss web. A specific note indicates that diagonal bracing is spaced as required by the bracing designer, with a maximum spacing of 48'-0\" specified. Another detail shows a lap connection for 2x4 diagonal bracing, spanning a minimum of two trusses and extending from the top chord to the bottom chord as needed. The overall system aims to provide lateral stability to the truss structure.",
