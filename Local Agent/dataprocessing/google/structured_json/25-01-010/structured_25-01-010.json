The elevation indicates various dimensions, including a total length of 170.250 units and a height of 162.000 units at the peak. The roof structure is detailed with angled lines and labeled components like \"KB1\" through \"KB5\", suggesting roof framing or bracing points. Dimensions such as 56.000, 23.938, 27.672, and 31.182 are shown along the roofline, defining its geometry. The wall is noted to have \"Fascia Boards - All around\" and \"Ripped 2X6\" elements. Blocking pieces, specifically \"2x10 Blocking Pieces (Middle of the Bunkie)\", are called out and referenced to \"See S2.0 for more detail\". The foundation is indicated as \"FOUNDATION BY OTHERS (TYP.)\" with a grade line and a dimension of 4.125 units. Notes regarding window allowances state, \"WE CAN ALLOW (3) WINDOWS TOTAL, ONE IN EACH SIDE IN THE USUAL CONFIGURATION FOR THIS BUNKIE. UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT ADD ADDITIONAL OPENING.\" The elevation also references \"SEE S6.0\" and \"SEE S2.0\", indicating further details are available on those sheets. The stacked wall construction is further detailed with horizontal lines representing the 2x6 boards, and individual levels are marked with \"K11\" tags from 1 to 19, indicating vertical stacking or framing elements.",
