The sill plate is secured with \\\"Ø anchor bolts at 48 inches on center. The detail also shows a slab portion with (4) 15M rebar and options for reinforcement including 6x6x\\% WWM, 16\" x 16\" 10M GRI, or Fibre Mesh. A 6mil poly vapour barrier is optional, placed over compacted Granular 'A' fill. Below the slab, a minimum of 2 inches (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation with a minimum compressive strength of 30 psi is specified. The drawing indicates a slope away from the foundation at 2% and notes the presence of insulation if applicable. The overall dimensions shown include a 6'-0\" length for the slab area and a 1'-0\" width for the thickened edge portion. The section is labeled '2/S1' and identified as 'THICKENED EDGE (12\" CURB OPTION)' with a scale of 1/2\"=1'-0\".",

The top surface of the slab is designed to slope away at 2% for drainage. Below the slab, a 6-inch minimum layer of compacted Granular 'A' fill is specified, over which a minimum of 2 inches (R10) of extruded polystyrene insulation with a minimum compressive strength of 30 psi is placed. An optional 6-mil poly vapour barrier is indicated. Alternative reinforcement options include 6x6x% WWM (Welded Wire Mesh), 16\" x 16\" 10M grid, or fibre mesh, suggesting flexibility in construction.
