The bracing consists of 2x4 diagonal braces, 2x4 struts, and 2x4 laterals. The diagonal braces are spaced as required by the bracing designer. The OCR text indicates that the 'SPACING AS SPECIFIED BY BRACE DESIGNER' has a '48'-0\" MAXIMUM'. The 2x4 struts are 'x 5'-0\" LONG' and are attached to the top and bottom of each truss web member with two 3\" nails. The 2x4 diagonal 'X' braces are located on the opposite side of the truss at endwalls where specified elsewhere. The diagonal braces are anchored to the laterals with four 3\" nails at the intersection of the truss web and truss lateral. The 2x4 laterals are butted at all splice locations, ensuring the butt joint is tight and centered on the truss web. The 2x4 diagonal braces are lapped (minimum 2 trusses) to ensure the diagonal brace extends completely from the top chord to the bottom chord of the truss.",
