Annex B(informative)
Fire resistance oflarge-cross-section wood elements
Notes:
1) This informative (non-mandatory) Annex has been written in normative (mandatory) language to facilitate
adoption where users ofthe Standard orregulatory authorities wish to adopt itformally as additional
requirements tothis Standard.
2) When this informational (non-mandatory) Annex is not otherwise adopted formally by building regulatory
authorities as additional requirements to this Standard, the methodology presented provides information that
may be useful to users ofthe Standard in the development of aproposal for an alternative solution to meet
the objectives ofthe National Building Code of Canada (NBC).
--------------------------------------------------
Clause 1: B.1.1 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.1
The design tables, data, and methods specified in Annex Bprovide adesign methodology to develop
fire-resistance ratings oflarge-cross-section wood elements based on structural criteria.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 2: B.1.2 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.2
The design methodology is intended to be used as an alternative approach for determining
fire-resistance ratings for establishing compliance to the National Building Code of Canada, as
determined by testing in conformance with CAN/ULC-S101.
Note: The fire performance criteria for evaluating the separating function of building elements related to the
passage offlames or hot gases and transmission of heat through the assembly, as defined in CAN/ULC-S101, are
outside the scope of Annex B, except as otherwise noted.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 3: B.1.3 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.3
The structural resistance of a wood element reduces as afunction of time when exposed to fire. A
structural element is deemed to possess afire-resistance rating for aduration offire exposure provided
the reduced structural resistance ofthe element, after the specified exposure time, is greater than the
specified load effects.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 4: B.1.4 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.4
The methodology in Annex Bis an engineering approach, intended to predict the structural fire
resistance oflarge-cross-section wood elements exposed to the standard fire-resistance test,
CAN/ULC-S101. The standard test method requires load-bearing elements to be tested with a
superimposed load that represents afull specified load condition or arestricted load use condition.
When calculating the fire-resistance rating using the methodology in Annex B,the specified gravity
loads are used (i.e., D+L).
Note: When aperformance-based fire safety design approach is used in which the specific fire scenario(s) has a
design fire(s) having time-temperature relationships other than that specified inthe CAN/ULC-S101 fire-resistance
test, additional analysis may berequired. For example, aheat transfer analysis may be needed to determine an
appropriate charring rate and zero-strength layer depth. In this case, it may also be appropriate to use the load
factors suggested in Paragraph 25 ofthe most recent edition ofStructural Commentary Aofthe National Building
Code of Canada. Such fire scenarios can be evaluated as an alternative solution to meet the objectives ofthe
National Building Code of Canada.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 5: B.1.5 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.5
Itis possible that built-up beams as described in Clause 6.4.4.3 and built-up compression members as
described in Clause 6.5.5.4 will not exhibit similar fire performance as similar-sized solid members and
therefore are beyond the scope of Annex B.
Note: Connections between built-up elements are critical for ensuring performance as asingle solid member and,
in some cases, have been shown to be unable to keep the individual elements from separating during fire exposure
thus significantly increasing the charring rate.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 6: B.2.1 
--------------------------------------------------
B.2.1 General Materials
Annex Bapplies to the materials specified in Clause 6for timbers and decking, Clause 7for glued-laminated
timber, Clause 8for cross-laminated timber, and Clause 15.3 for structural composite lumber.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 7: B.2.2 
--------------------------------------------------
B.2.2 Glued-laminated timber
To calculate the fire resistance of glulam beams using the specified strength values given in Table 7.2,
the following manufacturing requirements shall be fulfilled:
a) Beams targeting a1-hour fire-resistance rating when protected from fire exposure on the top shall
be manufactured to the specified layups, except that one core lamination shall be removed and
one 38-mm-thick outer tension lamination added on the bottom [see Figure B.1 b)].
b) Beams targeting a1-hour fire-resistance rating when not protected from fire exposure on the top
and subjected to positive and negative bending moments shall be manufactured to the specified
layups, except that two core laminations shall be removed and one 38-mm-thick outer tension
lamination added on the top and on the bottom [see Figure B.2 b)].
c) Beams targeting a1.5-or 2-hour fire-resistance rating when protected from fire exposure on the
top shall be manufactured to the specified layups, except that two core laminations shall be
removed and two 38-mm-thick outer tension laminations added on the bottom [see Figure B.1 c)].

the top and subjected to positive and negative bending moments shall be manufactured to the
specified layups, except that four core laminations shall be removed and two 38-mm-thick outer
tension laminations added on the top and on the bottom [see Figure B.2 c)].
Ifthe additional tension laminations are not substituted for core laminations, the specified strength
values ofthe individual laminations shall be used to calculate the fire resistance of glulam beams.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 8: B.2.3 
--------------------------------------------------
B.2.3 CLT
When determining the axial orflatwise-bending moment resistance of CLT panels exposed to fire, only
the layers parallel to the direction of the applied stress shall be considered in determination of the fire
resistance ofthe panels.
Note: When high shear stress governs design, such as apoint load from acolumn on afloor element, shear
resistance should be determined. In the case ofshear resistance, alllayers contributing tothe resistance should be
considered.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 9: B.3.1 
--------------------------------------------------
B.3.1 General Factors affecting resistance

The lateral-stability factor, KL, shall be determined in accordance with Clause 6.5.3.2 for sawn lumber or
Clause 7.5.6.4 for glued-laminated timber using the effective cross-section ofthe beam (see
Clause B.6.2). To be considered in the calculations, the members providing the intermediate lateral
support shall have atleast the same fire-resistance rating as that sought for the beam.

Clause 18: B.4.1 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.1 General Char layer depth 
The charring rates in Table B.2 apply when members are exposed to the standard fire exposure in
accordance with CAN/ULC-S101. Clause B.4.3 shall be used to determine the char layer depth for one-dimensional
heat transfer, such asin solid wood walls and floors or when corner rounding is explicitly
considered for rectangular cross-sections following Clause B.4.5. For CLT, the char layer depth shall be
determined in accordance with Clause B.4.6. For all other cases, the char layer depth shall be
determined in accordance with Clause B.4.4.
Note: Use ofthe notional charring rate in Clause B.4.4 isrecommended when considering rectangular cross-section
members because the method implicitly accounts for the effect ofcracking, formation offissures, and corner
rounding.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 19: B.4.2 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.2 Charring rates
The one-dimensional and notational charring rates, o and n, are given in Table B.2.

Note: When the smallest dimension ofthe effective cross-section ofa member subjected to heating on parallel
sides isreduced toless than 70 mm, the charring rate will increase asthe temperature rise beyond the char front
meets in the middle ofthe cross-section. In this case, aheat transfer analysis may be required to determine the
proper effective cross-section to use.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 20: B.4.3 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.3 One-dimensional char layer depth
The char layer depth for one-dimensional charring, xc,o (mm), shall be calculated asfollows:

--------------------------------------------------
B.4.4 Notional char layer depth
The char layer depth for notional charring, xc,n (mm), shall becalculated asfollows:
xc,n =βnt
where
βn= notional charring rate, mm/min
t=fire exposure duration, min
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 22: B.4.5 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.5 Corner rounding
The corners ofrectangular cross-sections exposed to fire are subjected to two-dimensional heat transfer
resulting in acorner-rounding effect. When explicitly considering the effect of corner rounding, the
radius ofthe corner shall be taken asthe depth ofthe charred layer using the one-dimensional charring
rate, in accordance with Clause B.4.3, and the section properties shall be determined accordingly.
Note: The effect of corner rounding is not required to be considered explicitly when the char layer depth is
determined in accordance with Clause B.4.4.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 23: B.4.6 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.6 Char layer depth for CLT
The one-dimensional charring rate, o, specified in Table B.2 and Clause B.4.3 shall be used when the
char layer depth will not reach the first bond line between the exposed layer and the subsequent layer
for the duration ofthe fire resistance required. Ifthe char layer depth surpasses the first bond line
during the fire-resistance period sought, the notional charring rate, n, specified in Table B.2 and
Clause B.4.4 shall be used.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 24: B.5 
--------------------------------------------------
B.5 Zero-strength layer depth
To account for areduction in strength ofthe heated wood beyond the char front, azero-strength layer
shall be subtracted to further reduce the cross-section beyond the char layer depth determined in
Clause B.4.3 orB.4.4. The zero-strength layer depth, xt(mm), shall be calculated asfollows:
xt=(t/20) x 7 (for t<20)
xt=7(for t>=20)
where
t =fire exposure duration, min
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 26: B.6.1

B.6.1 General
Charring ofall surfaces ofawood element directly exposed to fire shall be taken into account including,
where relevant, any surfaces initially protected from fire exposure where wood charring could occur at
some point during the standard fire exposure for fire-resistance rating required. The effective cross-section
shall be assumed to have properties as specified in Clauses B.6.3 and B.6.4, while the char layer
and zero-strength layer shall be assumed to provide no strength or stiffness.
Note: Only surfaces protected from fire exposure for the duration ofthe exposure, such asthe top surface of a
beam protected by afire-resistance-rated floor orroof assembly, may be considered to be protected from the fire
for the duration ofthe exposure.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 27: B.6.2 
--------------------------------------------------
B.6.2 Effective cross-section
The effective cross-section shall be the initial cross-section reduced by the char layer depth (see
Clause B.4) and the zero-strength layer depth (see Clause B.5) on each exposed surface (see Figure B.2).
Section properties shall be calculated using standard equations for area, section modulus, and moment
ofinertia using the dimensions ofthe effective cross-section.
Note: In some instances, such asthe effective cross-section of CLT, the location ofthe neutral axis must be
determined prior to calculating the moment ofinertia and section modulus. In addition, for calculating the section
modulus ofCLT, the height divided by 2(h/2) must bereplaced with c,the distance from the extreme (bottom)
tension fibre to the neutral axis, thus replacing 2/h with 1/c in the section modulus equation.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 28: B.6.3 
--------------------------------------------------
B.6.3 Resistance ofthe effective cross-section
The resistances ofthe members exposed to fire shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable
equations in Clauses 6, 7, 8and 15.3 using the strength properties modified in accordance with
Clause B.3 and the effective cross-section in accordance to Clause B.6.2.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 29: B.6.4 
--------------------------------------------------
B.6.4 Modulus of elasticity
The modulus of elasticity used in calculating the resistance of the member shall be taken as the
specified mean value.

additional fire resistance attributed to the gypsum board, provided the gypsum board fastener spacing
requirements in Clause B.8.2 are met and the fasteners used to attach the furring penetrate the wood structural
elements aminimum of 25 mm.
--------------------------------------------------
