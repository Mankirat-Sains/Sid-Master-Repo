Clause 30: 5.3
--------------------------------------------------
5.3 Conditions and factors affecting resistance
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 31: 5.3.1
--------------------------------------------------
5.3.1 General
Specified strengths and capacities in this Standard are based on the standard-term duration of loads,
dry-service conditions, and untreated materials. The specified strengths and capacities for materials and

connections shall be multiplied by the modification factors specified in this Clause and in the
appropriate clauses of this Standard.
Note: The basis for derivation of specified strengths for sawn lumber members is described in the CWC Standard
Practice Relating Specified Strengths of Structural Members to Characteristic Structural Properties. The principles
described therein have also been used to guide derivations for other products in this Standard.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 32: 5.3.2.1
--------------------------------------------------
5.3.2.1 Load-Duration factor, Kd General
Except as specified in Clause 5.3.2.2, the specified strengths and capacities shall be multiplied by a load-duration
factor, KD, in accordance with Table 5.1, but not exceeding 1.15.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 33: 5.3.2.2
--------------------------------------------------
5.3.2.2 Long-term load-duration factor
If the specified long-term load, PL, is greater than the specified standard-term load, Ps, a load-duration
factor of 0.65 may be used or KD may be calculated as follows:
KD = 1.0 – 0.50 log (PL/Ps) 0.65
where

PL = specified long-term load
Ps = specified standard-term load based on Snow (S) and Live (L) loads acting alone or in
combination
= S, L, S + 0.5L, or 0.5S + L, determined using importance factors equal to 1.0
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 34: 5.3.2.3
--------------------------------------------------
5.3.2.3 Combined loads
When the total specified load is made up of loads acting for different durations, the design shall be
based on the most severe combination. The load duration factor, KD, for the load of the shortest
duration may apply for that load combination, except as specified elsewhere in this Standard.
Note: The most severe combination requires consideration of both the effect of the factored load combinations and
the corresponding load-duration factor (which affects the resistance). The load combination that produces the
most critical effect might also correspond to a high load-duration factor (i.e., with a relatively higher resistance)
and therefore might not produce the most severe combination. Instead, a load combination producing a lower
effect but with a corresponding lower load-duration factor (i.e., with a lower resistance) might produce the more
severe combination.

structures, wood should be pressure treated with preservative in accordance with the requirements of
the CAN/CSA-O80 Series of Standards. If possible, all boring, grooving, cutting, and other fabrication
should be completed before treatment. Fabrication that is carried out after pressure treatment shall be
treated locally in accordance with the CAN/CSA-O80 Series of Standards.

a) Construct the shear force diagram for the beam. If the beam is under moving concentrated loads,
construct the diagram of the maximum shear forces occurring along the full length of the beam
without regard to sign convention. (Positive and negative maximum shear forces both show
positive.)
b) Divide the total beam length, L, into n segments of variable lengths, la, such that within each
segment there are neither abrupt changes nor changes from negative to positive in the shear force.
c) For each segment determine
i) VA = factored shear force at beginning of segment, N;
ii) VB = factored shear force at end of segment, N; and
iii) VC = factored shear force at centre of segment, N
and calculate the factor G as follows:
G = ℓ₀ * [VAs⁴ + VBs⁴ + 4VCs⁴]

d) Determine the coefficient, Cv, as follows:

i) For stationary loads:  
   Cv = 1.825 * Wf * (L / ΣG)^0.2

   where  
     Wf = the total of all factored loads applied to the beam, N

ii) For moving loads:  
   Cv = 1.825 * Wf * (L / ΣG)^0.2

   where  
     Wf = the total of all factored moving loads and all factored distributed loads applied to the beam, N

Additional information and alternative procedures
Notes:
1) This informative (non-mandatory) Annex has been written in normative (mandatory) language to facilitate
adoption where users ofthe Standard orregulatory authorities wish to adopt itformally as additional
requirements to this Standard.
2) The clause-numbering scheme in this Annex has been devised tofacilitate reference to related clauses in the
main body ofthis Standard.
A.5.3.5 System factor, KH
Itis well known that the behaviour of asingle member does not represent that of asystem such as a
floor or aflat roof with several joists orrafters. System behaviour can be accounted for in single-member
design by implementing system factors: KH for strength and K for serviceability. In this
Standard, only KH has been quantified.
The system factor, KH, is afunction ofthe parameters that define the mechanical state and physical
layout ofthe system. These parameters are the mean live load and its coefficient of variation, mean
modulus ofrupture (MOR) and its coefficient of variation, mean modulus ofelasticity (MOE) and its
coefficient ofvariation, MOE-MOR correlation, sheathing thickness, and connection stiffness.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 3: A.5.4.2.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.2.1 Wood frame deflection calculations
Wood frame systems connected with sheathing or cladding on one or both sides deflect less than the
joists, rafters, orstuds carrying the same loads independently. Traditionally, however, deflection
calculations have ignored this interaction and assumed that each framing member in these systems is
loaded individually on its tributary area. The deflection criteria that evolved from this approach have
provided satisfactory system performance based on calculated single-member deflections.
Itis possible to estimate system performance by calculating system factors greater than 1.0 as aratio of
system deflection to single-member deflection. Caution should be taken when implementing system
factors in traditional design procedures. Where design procedures incorporate asystem factor for
deflection, there is aneed to consider, before adjusting design procedure criteria, whether the system
effects add to enhancements that are already present in traditional wood frame performance.

Clause 4: A.5.4.2.2 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.2.2 Elastic deflection of wood light-frame wall systems under wind load
Typical wood light-frame wall systems designed for asingle-member deflection of 1/360 ofthe span can
satisfy the intent of masonry design specifications intended to limit the deflection of steel studs in high-rise
buildings to 1/720 ofthe span.
For example, the actual deflection would be approximately half ofthe deflection calculated on asingle
member basis under the following conditions:
a) lumber modulus of elasticity (see Table 6.4) derived from visually stress-graded lumber data;
b) lumber used in astud wall system (i.e., 38 ×89 mm or 38 ×140 mm) meeting minimum
requirements for the Case 2system factor (see Clause 6.4.4.2);
c) gypsum wallboard orstructural sheathing attached to the inside face ofthe studs in accordance
with minimum building code requirements; and
d) cladding and secondary member wind loading based on the tributary area of astud in alow-rise
building.

A.5.4.5 Vibration performance of wood joisted floors
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 6: A.5.4.5.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.5.1 Vibration-controlled span —General method
For single-span floor, except as permitted in Clause A.5.4.5.2 where the floor systems are constructed
with prefabricated wood I-joists, the maximum span for controlling vibration on wood joisted floor
systems that include floor joists and wood structural panel subfloor may be calculated using the
following equation:
ℓ_v = 0.122 * (E_leff)^0.284 / (K_tss^0.14 * m_L^0.15)

Where:
  ℓ_v     = vibration-controlled span, m
  E_leff  = effective composite bending stiffness of the floor system in the joist span direction, N·m²
            (see Clause A.5.4.5.1.1)
  K_tss   = factor to account for the transverse system stiffness contribution in reducing floor deflection
            (see Clause A.5.4.5.1.3)
  m_L     = linear mass of the composite cross section of the floor that accounts for the joist, subfloor,
            and topping, kg/m (see Clause A.5.4.5.1.2)
Notes:
1) The above equation applies to single-span floor simply supported at all supports and may be used for
multiple-span systems, in which case the longest span is used in the calculation and EIeff may beincreased by
20% to account for end-fixity effect. This increase does not apply to floors with acementitious topping.
2) Where lateral bracing elements are present that are structurally fastened to the joists, the calculated span
may beincreased by 5%, provided the spacing between adjacent lateral bracing elements orthe distance
between lateral bracing element and the nearest support is not more than 2 m. This span increase is not
permitted ifthe floor is topped with acementitious layer.
3) Where gypsum board is fastened to the underside ofthe joists directly, the calculated span may be increased
by 5%. This span increase is not permitted if the fastening ofthe gypsum board to the joists isthrough
acoustic fittings or atopping is accounted for in the calculation.
4) The span calculated using this Clause is expected to lead to wood joisted floor systems with performance that
is consistently acceptable to alarge majority ofthe occupants. Manufacturers of engineered joist products
may use other mechanics-based or empirical methods in the development ofspan charts to provide a
different level of user acceptance iftheir use has been supported by testing, engineering analysis, or
performance history, and the development ofthe alternative method was approved by an appropriate
certification body. These manufacturers may also provide further guidance beyond the scope ofthe method
presented in this Annex clause. (See CWC Commentary on CSA O86.)

direction
The calculation of effective composite bending stiffness ofthe floor system in the span direction in

used to estimate the effective bending stiffness of the floor system if composite section approach is
used. Figure A.1 provides the definitions ofthe symbols.

        E_Ac  = axial stiffness of 1 m wide topping, N/m (see Table A.2)

    b₁ = spacing of joist, m
    S₁ = load-slip modulus per unit spacing for subfloor-to-joist connection
       = 5 x 10⁶ N/m/m for mechanical joint or when topping is present
       = 1 x 10⁸ N/m/m for glued joint
    L₁ = width of subfloor panels in the span direction for floor without topping, m
         (or span for floor with topping), m

Ā = E_Ajoist + Ē_A1, N

  where:
    E_Ajoist = axial stiffness of joist, N

γ̄ = h₁ Ē_A1 / Ā, m

  where:
    h₁ = (d + E_A1 t_s / L₁ + E_Ac(t_c + t_s / 2)) / (E_A1 + E_Ac), m

t_s = thickness of subfloor, m

Notes:
1) Apparent bending stiffness ofjoist, EIjoist, accounts for influence ofshear and slips at mechanical joints on
stiffness properties ofthe floor system. See CWC Commentary for guidance on calculation ofEIjoist.

K_tss = 0.0294 + 0.536 * K₁^0.25 + 0.516 * K₁^0.5 - 0.31 * K₁^0.75

Where:

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 11: A.5.4.6 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.6 Building movements due to moisture content change
Most buildings can accommodate small amounts of movement due to moisture content change in wood
members. However, if not considered during design and construction, differential movements can
become visible or even cause structural orserviceability problems. The considerations for differential
movements become more critical for higher buildings due to the cumulative effect of movement.
Shrinkage can contribute to overall lateral drift but can be mitigated using shrinkage compensators and
materials subject to less dimensional change.
Attention should be paid to the following areas to avoid potential shrinkage and swelling-related
problems in the design, where:
a) non-uniform movements could occur;
b) metal connectors are used to support large sawn and glulam timber components;
c) differential movements could cause distress in the finish materials or building envelope; and
d) differential movements could cause distress in plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems.

Compatibility with other materials should be considered in the design detailing. Assuming similar
members are exposed to the same environmental conditions, itis reasonable to assume the same
degree ofshrinkage or swelling will occur along each load path. Where wood members are exposed to
different environmental conditions (e.g., some members are in aconditioned space while others are in
an unconditioned space), a more detailed analysis is warranted. Similarly, expected movement in non-wood
members, such as contraction or expansion due to temperature changes should be considered.
The shrinkage or swelling of a wood member between the initial and final moisture content may be
estimated using the following equation:

S=D×(Mi –Mf) ×c

--------------------------------------------------
A.6.2.1.2 Availability oflumber
The availability oflarge-size and long-length timbers (Beams and Stringers and Posts and Timbers
Grades) should always be confirmed with suppliers prior to specifying. Sizes up to 394 ×394 mm are
generally available in the Douglas Fir-Larch and Hem-Fir species combinations; however, S-P-F and
Northern Species timbers are available only in smaller sizes.
Machine stress-rated lumber and machine evaluated lumber are commonly produced for specialty
applications such aslight-frame trusses and I-joists. Some designers specify machine graded lumber to
take advantage ofthe higher stiffness and strength properties.
The most commonly available grades of machine stress-rated lumber are 1650f-1.5E, 1800f-1.6E,
2100f-1.8E, and 2400f-2.0E; the most common sizes are 38 ×89 mm and 38 ×140 mm. The availability
of other grades and sizes should be confirmed with suppliers prior to specifying.

Except for members designed in accordance with Clause 6.5.12, the following procedure may be used to
determine the factored compressive resistance parallel to grain of members subject to acompressive
stress that is not uniform along its length, either due to concentrated loads or distributed loads:
a) Divide the member into two sections with lengths L1and L2asfollows:
L1=length of member with amaximum factored compressive force Pf1, mm
L2=length of member with amaximum factored compressive force Pf2, mm
such that Pf1 <Pf2
b) Determine the factored compressive resistance parallel to grain, Pr1, ofsection L1in accordance

KZc =6.3 (d L’)-0.13<1.3
where
d=dimension in direction ofbuckling (depth or width), mm
L’=L1(Pf1/Pf2)7.9 +L2, mm

A.6.5.6 Compression perpendicular to grain
A relationship between mean compressive strength perpendicular to grain and mean oven-dry wood
density was introduced to establish aconsistent basis for bearing strengths for various products in the
1994 edition ofthis Standard. Itis asfollows:
fcp =0.9L(2243.8G –473.8)/M
where
fcp =specified strength incompression perpendicular to grain, MPa
0.9 =factor applied to obtain alower tolerance limit
L =conversion factor to limit states desing and standard term load duration
    =1.8125
G = mean oven-dry relative density
M = conversion factor for metric units
    = 145.038
Tables 6.8 and 6.9 assign increased compression perpendicular to grain design values to specific grades
of Spruce-Pine-Fir or Hem-Fir machine-graded lumber, which have higher mean density than visually
stress-graded lumber of the same species (see Table A.11).

The NLGA Standard Grading Rules for Canadian Lumber also includes provisions for mills producing any
grade of machine-graded lumber to qualify for other density values based on tests, daily quality control,
and marking the qualified density value on the lumber. In these cases the rules provide for compression
perpendicular values to be based on the marked density value and the formula specified in this Clause,
without the 0.9 tolerance limit.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 43: A.6.5.12.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.1 Scope Specific truss applications
Fully triangulated —The modified design procedures of Clause 6.5.12* apply only to sawn lumber used
in trusses where all the members form aside of atriangle. In such asystem, abending failure at apanel
point of acompression member would not normally result in collapse ofthe triangle. An attic truss is
not afully triangulated system. Also, the ends oftop chords in top-chord-bearing trusses, and top-chord
overhangs (i.e., outward extensions oftruss chords beyond the panel points) do not fall within the
scope of Clause A.6.5.12 and therefore are not considered part ofthe overall truss length.
*The modified design procedures ofClause 6.5.12 are based onresearch reported in C.Lum, E.Jones, and B. Hintz
(1996).
Clear span limitation —The 12.2 mclear span limitation is consistent with that for snow loading for
National Building Code of Canada Part 9structures (see Subsection 9.4.2). When the 12.2 mspan limit
is exceeded or when other conditions are in effect, an 80% snow load factor shall be used (i.e., the truss
is designed as aPart 4truss). When the 610 mm spacing limit is exceeded, the 80% snow load factor
shall be used and the KHfactor isreduced from 1.1 to 1.0.
Truss configuration —Clause A.6.5.12 limits the applicability of Clause 6.5.12 to roof trusses with
slopes that are similar to those trusses tested. Compared to the standard pitched chord trusses
evaluated in the testing program, very low pitch (less than 2in 12) roof and flat trusses have ahigher
axial force to bending moment ratio and are excluded from coverage in this Standard.
The overall length is alimit that the truss industry has traditionally used to place additional limits on
design. The two limits, 12.2 mclear span and the 18.0 moverall length, provide aboundary between
traditional residential spans and long span roof trusses. Below the 18.0 moverall truss length limit, the
truss may consist ofcantilevers or multiple clear spans, or both, provided that no single span exceeds
12.2 m.
Girder, bowstring, semi-circular, attic, flat, and floor trusses are outside the scope of Clause A.6.5.12.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 44: A.6.5.12.3 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.3 Compressive resistance parallel to grain
Effective length —Recommended effective-length factors are specified in Table A.4. TPIC also provides
recommendations on the effective length oftruss compression members. Factor selection depends on
the load distribution and the type ofstructure.
Compression-chord splices —For strength and deflection calculations, acompression-chord splice may
be considered continuous ifitislocated at aninflection point for the load case being considered. To
allow for changes in lumber length, the splice need only be within ±10% ofthe panel length from the
inflection point. This allowance also recognizes that the location ofthe inflection point will depend on
the loading condition.
Size effects incompression —In most cases, the member length for computing KZcisthe panel length;
between panel points, the axial force changes little compared with changes at the panel points. In cases
where the axial stresses are high relative to the bending stresses, resulting in relatively short panel
lengths, and where the axial forces are relatively constant between adjacent panels, the member length
for computing KZc should include several panels. One-half the chord length between pitch breaks has
been judged to cover these cases.
Note: Apitch break is apoint along the chord analogue line where the slope ofthe chord changes.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 45: A.6.5.12.4 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.4 Compressive resistance perpendicular to grain
Bearing reinforcement —Bearing reinforcement consists ofapplying truss plates to both sides of a
member that can be subjected to compression perpendicular to grain stresses through the depth ofthe
member. Designs also need to meet the basic bearing requirement of Clause 6.5.6.1.
Note: Testing to support this method ofimproving the bearing resistance is described in Bulmanis, N.S., Latos,
H. A., and Keenan F.J.(1983).
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 46: A.6.5.12.5 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.5 Resistance to combined bending and axial load
Amplified moments —The proposed design procedures have been written to cover the general case
where amplified moments are used. Although moment amplification should not be ignored, some
structures can be accurately analyzed without having to use analysis methods that include moment
amplification. An analysis of moment amplification in trusses indicated that mid-panel moments were
more susceptible to P-delta effects, while panel point moments were less susceptible. Furthermore, the
amount of moment amplification calculated is sensitive to the type ofstructure and the analogue
assumptions.
Results from the testing program suggest that the design procedure used by TPIC results in trusses that
exhibit satisfactory levels of performance. The TPIC design approach does not include moment
amplification; however, the procedure does require that the mid-panel deflection be limited. This, in
effect, limits the length oftruss panels, even though the chord member can possess the required
strength. Ifthe deflection limitations in TPIC are not used tolimit panel length, itis possible that the
bending capacity modification factor, KM, from Table 6.19 will not be appropriate.
Bending capacity modification factor, KM —In addition to being afunction ofthe member’s span-to-depth
ratio, the KM factor, calculated from Table 6.19,* also depends on the shape ofthe moment
diagram.
AKMfactor greater than 1generally indicates abending moment distribution with one or more
inflection points in the member between panel points, and apanel point moment that is higher than
the mid-panel moment.

For cases where the mid-panel moment is higher than the panel point moments or where the loading is
such that there are noinflection points inthe panel, the KMfactor isgenerally less than 1.
For other cases where the structural analysis indicates zero moment atthe panel points (i.e., M2 =0),
the bending capacity increase will simply be afunction ofthe span-to-depth ratio. This generally occurs
at pitch breaks or panel point splices, where, although the bending moments are not necessarily zero,
designers traditionally assume apin connection. However, afictitious analogue member, such as that
used to model aheel joint in apitched chord truss, is considered to introduce apanel point moment in
the heel. Therefore, the top chord of aking post truss can be assumed to be continuous over apanel
point atthe heel, but not atthe peak.
The test trusses and trusses analyzed in the impact study, which are considered typical designs, result in
values of KM up to 1.3. The upper limit on KM at 1.3 has been introduced to prevent extrapolation to
higher values.
*The KM factors calculated from Table 6.19 are based on Lau, W., Barrett, J. D., and Lam, F.(1995).
Interaction equation —The modification to the axial ratio term was introduced to recognize the
increase in bending capacity when abrittle material is subjected to axial compression in addition to
bending. The KM factor is used to adjust the bending capacity for various moment configurations in the
top chords.
These two changes to the design of compression chords help to explain the satisfactory levels of safety
observed in the test trusses.
No increase is permitted for combined tension and bending members, asthe testing program was not
designed to evaluate the performance of tension chord members.

A.7.5.5 Standard sizes for glued-laminated timber-GLM
The standard dimensions for glued-laminated timber are asfollows:
a) widths of 80, 130, 175, 215, 265, 315, and 365 mm; and
b) depths, as calculated for
i)straight or cambered members, in multiples of38 mm; and
ii) members curved to aradius of curvature less than 10 800 mm, in multiples ofthe required
lamination thickness (see Table A.7).
Notes:
1) Commercially available widths can vary.
2)For widths greater than 365 mm, designers should check availability before specifying.

Clause 48: A.8.5.2 
--------------------------------------------------
A.8.5.2 Deflection of CLT panels -Cross laminated Timber (CLT)
The maximum deflection ofaCLT panel, max, may be calculated as the sum of deflections under short-and
long-term loads asfollows:
Δ_max = Δ_ST + Δ_LT * K_creep

Where:
  Δ_ST    = elastic deflection due to short-term and/or standard-term loads, without dead loads in combination
  Δ_LT    = instantaneous elastic deflection due to long-term loads
  K_creep = creep adjustment factor
          = 2.0 for dry-service condition

Deflection under a specified uniformly distributed load, ω, acting perpendicular to the face of a single-span panel
may be calculated as the sum of the deflections due to moment and shear effects using:

- Effective flatwise bending stiffness, (EI)_eff,f
- Effective shear stiffness in flatwise bending, (GA)_eff,f

Formula:
Δ = (5 / 384) * (ω * L⁴ / (EI)_eff,f) + (1 / 8) * (ω * L² / (GA)_eff,f)

For aconcentrated line load, P,located inthe middle ofasingle span CLT panel acting perpendicular to
the panel, the deflection may be calculated as follows:
Δ = (1/48) * (P * L³) / (EI)_eff,f + (1/4) * (P * L) / (GA)_eff,f

Note: Where the shear deformation component ofthe total deformation of CLT panel under out-of-plane standard-term
loading such assnow and live loads issignificant (i.e., in short spans, short span cantilever, etc.) as
determined by the designer, the shear deformation under these loads should be increased by 30% to account for
time-dependent effect associated with rolling shear.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 49: A.8.5.3 
--------------------------------------------------
A.8.5.3 A.8.5.3 Vibration performance ofCLT floors
The allowable span for the control offloor motions caused by walking on aCLT floor may be calculated
using the following equation:

ℓ_v ≤ 0.11 * [(EI)_eff,f / 10⁶]^0.29 / m^0.12

Where:
  ℓ_v        = vibration-controlled span limit, m
  (EI)_eff,f = effective flatwise bending stiffness for a 1 m wide panel, N·mm² (see Clause 8.4.3.2)
  m          = linear mass of CLT for a 1 m wide panel, kg/m

Note: The above equation assumes the floor:
  a) has a single span with both ends simply supported; and
  b) is bare with no topping material.

For multiple-span floors with anon-structural element that is considered to provide enhanced vibration
effect, the calculated vibration-controlled span may beincreased by up to 20%, provided itis not
greater than 8 m.
Notes:
1) The calculation procedure given in this Clause for single-span systems may be applied to individual spans in a
multiple-span system, with adjustment if appropriate.
2) For floors with concrete topping, where the concrete is applied directly tothe CLT panel, this equation may be
used assuming bare floor construction for calculation purposes, i.e., weight ofconcrete isignored in
calculating the mass, m,provided the area density ofthe topping is not greater than twice the bare CLT floor
area density.
3) The current vibration criteria might not address all occupant performance expectations. CLT manufacturer
literature may provide additional span adjustments.

A.9.2.2 Construction sheathing OSB-Structural Panels
As noted inits preface, CSA O325 does not recommend engineering design values, nor does itsuggest
methods ofcalculating such values.
The design values in Table 9.3 for construction sheathing OSB that complies with CSA O325 are
consistent with values developed through in-grade testing and supported by various organizations.
Certification organizations shall ensure that reference values for bending strength and bending stiffness
of construction sheathing OSB that complies with CSA O325 are also consistent with the design values
ofthis Standard.

Panel marks consist of an end-use mark followed by aspan mark (see Table A.8), e.g., 2F24 or W16.
Multiple panel marks may be shown on panels qualified for more than one end use, e.g., 1R24/2F16
and 2R48/2F24/1F24.

asthe maximum factored load applied perpendicular to the compression flange, shall be calculated as
follows:

B_r = φ * X_B * [(2h_w + h_t + h_c)(10^9)] / [2 * (s * ℓ_p)^2]

Where:
  B_r = factored buckling resistance, kN/m²

Clause 53: A.11.7.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.11.7.1 Deflection of shearwalls in multi-storey buidlings
a) Deflection of blocked shearwall segments:
  The interstorey drift, Δ_i^storey, at the i-th level, mm, may be calculated as follows:
Δ_i^storey = Δ_b,i^storey + Δ_s,i^storey + Δ_n,i^storey + Δ_a,i^storey

Where:
  Δ_b,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to bending
  Δ_s,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to panel shear
  Δ_n,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to nail slip
  Δ_a,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to wall anchorage system elongation

The total deflection Δ_i^total at the i-th level is:

Δ_i^total = Σ_{j=1}^{i} Δ_j^storey

i) Deflection due to bending:
   Δ_b,i^storey = Δ_θ,i + (H_i² / 2) * (θ_i - θ_i-1)

Where:
  θ_i (or θ_j) = change in slope over the i-th storey height:
               = M_i * H_i / (EI)_i

Δ_θ,i = H_i² * q_i / (3 * E_i * I)

Δ_a,i = horizontal distance from top of i-th storey to tangent at the bottom:
       = M_i * H_i² / (2 * E_i * I) + V_i * H_i³ / (3 * E_i * I)

Where:
  H_i = interstorey height of the i-th storey, mm
  V_i = shear force in the i-th storey:
      = Σ_j=1^i F_j = F_1 + F_2 + ... + F_n

  M_i = overturning moment at level i:
      = Σ_j=i+1^n V_j * H_j

  n = total number of stories
  F_j = lateral force at j-th level
  H_j = interstorey height at j-th level

Where:
  E = modulus of elasticity at shearwall segment boundary, N/mm²
  A = cross-sectional area of the vertical member, mm²

Ls =length ofshearwall segment, mm
Note: For acontinuous rod system anchored ateach floor level, the effective bending stiffness ofthe
shearwall should be used.

ii) Deflection due to panel shear:
Δ_s,i^storey = Δ_s,i

Where:
  Δ_s,i = v_f,i * H_i / B_v,i

  Where:
    v_f,i = V_i / L_i = maximum shear flow due to specified loads at the top of the wall at the i-th storey, N/mm
    B_v,i = shear-through-thickness rigidity of the sheathing at the i-th storey, N/mm
            (see Tables 9.1 to 9.3 for wood structural panel sheathing)
            For gypsum wallboard, B_v may be taken as 7000 N/mm

iii) Deflection due to sheathing-to-framing connection deformation:
Δ_n,i^storey = Δ_n,i

Where:
  Δ_n,i = 0.0025 * H_i * e_n,i

  Where:
    e_n,i = sheathing-to-framing connection deformation at the i-th storey, mm
            (see Clause A.11.7.1)

iv) Deflection due to elongation in wall anchorage system:
Δ_a,i^storey = H_i * (Σ_{j=i+1}^{n} α_j) = H_i * α_i + H_i * (Σ_{j=1}^{i-1} α_j)

Where:
  α_i = (d_a,i) / L_a

  Where:
    d_a,i = total vertical elongation of the wall anchorage system at the i-th storey
b) Deflection of unblocked shearwall segments:

The interstorey drift of an unblocked shearwall segment with wood structural panels at the i-th storey may be calculated as:

Δ_ub,i^storey = Δ_b,i^storey / J_us,i

Where:
  Δ_ub,i^storey = interstorey drift of a blocked shearwall segment at the i-th level
  J_us,i        = adjustment factor for unblocked shearwall segment at the i-th level

Note: This Clause is appropriate for a typical light-frame wood shearwall cantilevered from its base assuming
the shearwall is stacked for the full height of the building. This is purely a mechanics-based approach to
determine the deflection for a cantilevered single wall acting as a component of the building. There could be
other factors that affect the behaviour of a wall, which should be accounted for by the designer.

Annex B(informative)
Fire resistance oflarge-cross-section wood elements
Notes:
1) This informative (non-mandatory) Annex has been written in normative (mandatory) language to facilitate
adoption where users ofthe Standard orregulatory authorities wish to adopt itformally as additional
requirements tothis Standard.
2) When this informational (non-mandatory) Annex is not otherwise adopted formally by building regulatory
authorities as additional requirements to this Standard, the methodology presented provides information that
may be useful to users ofthe Standard in the development of aproposal for an alternative solution to meet
the objectives ofthe National Building Code of Canada (NBC).
B.1.1
The design tables, data, and methods specified in Annex Bprovide adesign methodology to develop
fire-resistance ratings oflarge-cross-section wood elements based on structural criteria.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 2: B.1.2 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.2
The design methodology is intended to be used as an alternative approach for determining
fire-resistance ratings for establishing compliance to the National Building Code of Canada, as
determined by testing in conformance with CAN/ULC-S101.
Note: The fire performance criteria for evaluating the separating function of building elements related to the
passage offlames or hot gases and transmission of heat through the assembly, as defined in CAN/ULC-S101, are
outside the scope of Annex B, except as otherwise noted.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 3: B.1.3 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.3
The structural resistance of a wood element reduces as afunction of time when exposed to fire. A
structural element is deemed to possess afire-resistance rating for aduration offire exposure provided
the reduced structural resistance ofthe element, after the specified exposure time, is greater than the
specified load effects.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 4: B.1.4 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.4
The methodology in Annex Bis an engineering approach, intended to predict the structural fire
resistance oflarge-cross-section wood elements exposed to the standard fire-resistance test,
CAN/ULC-S101. The standard test method requires load-bearing elements to be tested with a
superimposed load that represents afull specified load condition or arestricted load use condition.
When calculating the fire-resistance rating using the methodology in Annex B,the specified gravity
loads are used (i.e., D+L).
Note: When aperformance-based fire safety design approach is used in which the specific fire scenario(s) has a
design fire(s) having time-temperature relationships other than that specified inthe CAN/ULC-S101 fire-resistance
test, additional analysis may berequired. For example, aheat transfer analysis may be needed to determine an
appropriate charring rate and zero-strength layer depth. In this case, it may also be appropriate to use the load
factors suggested in Paragraph 25 ofthe most recent edition ofStructural Commentary Aofthe National Building
Code of Canada. Such fire scenarios can be evaluated as an alternative solution to meet the objectives ofthe
National Building Code of Canada.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 5: B.1.5 
--------------------------------------------------
B.1.5
Itis possible that built-up beams as described in Clause 6.4.4.3 and built-up compression members as
described in Clause 6.5.5.4 will not exhibit similar fire performance as similar-sized solid members and
therefore are beyond the scope of Annex B.
Note: Connections between built-up elements are critical for ensuring performance as asingle solid member and,
in some cases, have been shown to be unable to keep the individual elements from separating during fire exposure
thus significantly increasing the charring rate.

B.2.2 Glued-laminated timber
To calculate the fire resistance of glulam beams using the specified strength values given in Table 7.2,

When determining the axial orflatwise-bending moment resistance of CLT panels exposed to fire, only
the layers parallel to the direction of the applied stress shall be considered in determination of the fire
resistance ofthe panels.
Note: When high shear stress governs design, such as apoint load from acolumn on afloor element, shear
resistance should be determined. In the case ofshear resistance, alllayers contributing tothe resistance should be
considered.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 9: B.3.1 
--------------------------------------------------
B.3.1 General Factors affecting resistance

Clause 18: B.4.1 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.1 General Char layer depth 
The charring rates in Table B.2 apply when members are exposed to the standard fire exposure in
accordance with CAN/ULC-S101. Clause B.4.3 shall be used to determine the char layer depth for one-dimensional
heat transfer, such asin solid wood walls and floors or when corner rounding is explicitly
considered for rectangular cross-sections following Clause B.4.5. For CLT, the char layer depth shall be
determined in accordance with Clause B.4.6. For all other cases, the char layer depth shall be
determined in accordance with Clause B.4.4.
Note: Use ofthe notional charring rate in Clause B.4.4 isrecommended when considering rectangular cross-section
members because the method implicitly accounts for the effect ofcracking, formation offissures, and corner
rounding.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 19: B.4.2 
--------------------------------------------------
B.4.2 Charring rates
The one-dimensional and notational charring rates, o and n, are given in Table B.2.

Note: When the smallest dimension ofthe effective cross-section ofa member subjected to heating on parallel
sides isreduced toless than 70 mm, the charring rate will increase asthe temperature rise beyond the char front
meets in the middle ofthe cross-section. In this case, aheat transfer analysis may be required to determine the
proper effective cross-section to use.

resulting in acorner-rounding effect. When explicitly considering the effect of corner rounding, the
radius ofthe corner shall be taken asthe depth ofthe charred layer using the one-dimensional charring
rate, in accordance with Clause B.4.3, and the section properties shall be determined accordingly.
Note: The effect of corner rounding is not required to be considered explicitly when the char layer depth is
determined in accordance with Clause B.4.4.

B.6.1 General
Charring ofall surfaces ofawood element directly exposed to fire shall be taken into account including,
where relevant, any surfaces initially protected from fire exposure where wood charring could occur at
some point during the standard fire exposure for fire-resistance rating required. The effective cross-section
shall be assumed to have properties as specified in Clauses B.6.3 and B.6.4, while the char layer
and zero-strength layer shall be assumed to provide no strength or stiffness.
Note: Only surfaces protected from fire exposure for the duration ofthe exposure, such asthe top surface of a
beam protected by afire-resistance-rated floor orroof assembly, may be considered to be protected from the fire
for the duration ofthe exposure.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 27: B.6.2

Section properties shall be calculated using standard equations for area, section modulus, and moment
ofinertia using the dimensions ofthe effective cross-section.
Note: In some instances, such asthe effective cross-section of CLT, the location ofthe neutral axis must be
determined prior to calculating the moment ofinertia and section modulus. In addition, for calculating the section
modulus ofCLT, the height divided by 2(h/2) must bereplaced with c,the distance from the extreme (bottom)
tension fibre to the neutral axis, thus replacing 2/h with 1/c in the section modulus equation.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 28: B.6.3 
--------------------------------------------------
B.6.3 Resistance ofthe effective cross-section
The resistances ofthe members exposed to fire shall be calculated in accordance with the applicable
