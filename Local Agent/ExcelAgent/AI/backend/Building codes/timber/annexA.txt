Clause 1: A.5.3.5 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.3.5 System factor, KH
Itis well known that the behaviour of asingle member does not represent that of asystem such as a
floor or aflat roof with several joists orrafters. System behaviour can be accounted for in single-member
design by implementing system factors: KH for strength and K for serviceability. In this
Standard, only KH has been quantified.
The system factor, KH, is afunction ofthe parameters that define the mechanical state and physical
layout ofthe system. These parameters are the mean live load and its coefficient of variation, mean
modulus ofrupture (MOR) and its coefficient of variation, mean modulus ofelasticity (MOE) and its
coefficient ofvariation, MOE-MOR correlation, sheathing thickness, and connection stiffness.

A.5.4.2 Elastic deflection of wood light-frame systems under static loads
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 3: A.5.4.2.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.2.1 Wood frame deflection calculations
Wood frame systems connected with sheathing or cladding on one or both sides deflect less than the
joists, rafters, orstuds carrying the same loads independently. Traditionally, however, deflection
calculations have ignored this interaction and assumed that each framing member in these systems is
loaded individually on its tributary area. The deflection criteria that evolved from this approach have
provided satisfactory system performance based on calculated single-member deflections.
Itis possible to estimate system performance by calculating system factors greater than 1.0 as aratio of
system deflection to single-member deflection. Caution should be taken when implementing system
factors in traditional design procedures. Where design procedures incorporate asystem factor for
deflection, there is aneed to consider, before adjusting design procedure criteria, whether the system
effects add to enhancements that are already present in traditional wood frame performance.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 4: A.5.4.2.2 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.2.2 Elastic deflection of wood light-frame wall systems under wind load
Typical wood light-frame wall systems designed for asingle-member deflection of 1/360 ofthe span can
satisfy the intent of masonry design specifications intended to limit the deflection of steel studs in high-rise
buildings to 1/720 ofthe span.
For example, the actual deflection would be approximately half ofthe deflection calculated on asingle
member basis under the following conditions:
a) lumber modulus of elasticity (see Table 6.4) derived from visually stress-graded lumber data;
b) lumber used in astud wall system (i.e., 38 ×89 mm or 38 ×140 mm) meeting minimum
requirements for the Case 2system factor (see Clause 6.4.4.2);
c) gypsum wallboard orstructural sheathing attached to the inside face ofthe studs in accordance
with minimum building code requirements; and
d) cladding and secondary member wind loading based on the tributary area of astud in alow-rise
building.

A.5.4.5 Vibration performance of wood joisted floors
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 6: A.5.4.5.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.5.1 Vibration-controlled span —General method
For single-span floor, except as permitted in Clause A.5.4.5.2 where the floor systems are constructed
with prefabricated wood I-joists, the maximum span for controlling vibration on wood joisted floor
systems that include floor joists and wood structural panel subfloor may be calculated using the
following equation:
ℓ_v = 0.122 * (E_leff)^0.284 / (K_tss^0.14 * m_L^0.15)

Where:
  ℓ_v     = vibration-controlled span, m
  E_leff  = effective composite bending stiffness of the floor system in the joist span direction, N·m²
            (see Clause A.5.4.5.1.1)
  K_tss   = factor to account for the transverse system stiffness contribution in reducing floor deflection
            (see Clause A.5.4.5.1.3)
  m_L     = linear mass of the composite cross section of the floor that accounts for the joist, subfloor,
            and topping, kg/m (see Clause A.5.4.5.1.2)
Notes:
1) The above equation applies to single-span floor simply supported at all supports and may be used for
multiple-span systems, in which case the longest span is used in the calculation and EIeff may beincreased by
20% to account for end-fixity effect. This increase does not apply to floors with acementitious topping.
2) Where lateral bracing elements are present that are structurally fastened to the joists, the calculated span
may beincreased by 5%, provided the spacing between adjacent lateral bracing elements orthe distance
between lateral bracing element and the nearest support is not more than 2 m. This span increase is not
permitted ifthe floor is topped with acementitious layer.
3) Where gypsum board is fastened to the underside ofthe joists directly, the calculated span may be increased
by 5%. This span increase is not permitted if the fastening ofthe gypsum board to the joists isthrough
acoustic fittings or atopping is accounted for in the calculation.
4) The span calculated using this Clause is expected to lead to wood joisted floor systems with performance that
is consistently acceptable to alarge majority ofthe occupants. Manufacturers of engineered joist products
may use other mechanics-based or empirical methods in the development ofspan charts to provide a
different level of user acceptance iftheir use has been supported by testing, engineering analysis, or
performance history, and the development ofthe alternative method was approved by an appropriate
certification body. These manufacturers may also provide further guidance beyond the scope ofthe method
presented in this Annex clause. (See CWC Commentary on CSA O86.)

Clause 7: A.5.4.5.1.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.5.1.1 Effective composite bending stiffness offloor system in joist span
direction
The calculation of effective composite bending stiffness ofthe floor system in the span direction in
N•m2, EIeff, considers the contribution ofthe joist, subfloor, and topping. The following equation can be
used to estimate the effective bending stiffness of the floor system if composite section approach is
used. Figure A.1 provides the definitions ofthe symbols.
E_leff = E_Iu + Ē_A1 h̄_1^2 - Ā γ̄^2

Where:

E_Iu = E_Ijoist + b₁(E_ISL + E_Ic), N·m²

  where:
    E_Ijoist = apparent bending stiffness of joist, N·m²
    E_ISL    = bending stiffness of 1 m wide subfloor panel in span direction, N·m (see Table A.1)
    E_Ic     = bending stiffness of 1 m wide topping, N·m
            = E_c t_c³ / 12
              where:
                E_c = modulus of elasticity of topping, N/m² (see Table A.2)
                t_c = topping thickness, m

Ē_A1 = (b₁ E_A1) / (1 + b₁ S₁ / L₁), N

  where:
    E_A1 = E_ASL + E_Ac
      where:
        E_ASL = axial stiffness of 1 m wide subfloor panel in span direction, N/m (see Table A.1)
        E_Ac  = axial stiffness of 1 m wide topping, N/m (see Table A.2)

    b₁ = spacing of joist, m
    S₁ = load-slip modulus per unit spacing for subfloor-to-joist connection
       = 5 x 10⁶ N/m/m for mechanical joint or when topping is present
       = 1 x 10⁸ N/m/m for glued joint
    L₁ = width of subfloor panels in the span direction for floor without topping, m
         (or span for floor with topping), m

Ā = E_Ajoist + Ē_A1, N

  where:
    E_Ajoist = axial stiffness of joist, N

γ̄ = h₁ Ē_A1 / Ā, m

  where:
    h₁ = (d + E_A1 t_s / L₁ + E_Ac(t_c + t_s / 2)) / (E_A1 + E_Ac), m

t_s = thickness of subfloor, m

Notes:
1) Apparent bending stiffness ofjoist, EIjoist, accounts for influence ofshear and slips at mechanical joints on
stiffness properties ofthe floor system. See CWC Commentary for guidance on calculation ofEIjoist.
2) Mechanical properties and density of subfloor panels and topping materials are provided in Tables A.1
and A.2.=axial stiffness ofjoist, N= modulus of elasticity oftopping, N/m2 (see Table A.2)

--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.5.1.2 Linear mass offloor injoist span direction
The linear mass ofthe floor in the joist span direction, mL,in kg/m is the summation of all components
and shall be calculated asfollows:
mL=mJ+ρstsb1 +ρctcb1
where
mJ = mass per unit length ofjoist, kg/m
ρs= density ofsubfloor, kg/m3 (see Table A.1)
ρc= density oftopping, if present, kg/m3 (see Table A.2)
Note: The mass of gypsum board is not required in the calculation ofmL.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 9: A.5.4.5.1.3 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.5.1.3 A.5.4.5.1.3 Transverse system stiffness factor
The transverse system stiffness factor, Ktss, accounts for the contribution ofthe subfloor and topping in
reducing static deflection ofthe floor under apoint load and is calculated using the following equation:
K_tss = 0.0294 + 0.536 * K₁^0.25 + 0.516 * K₁^0.5 - 0.31 * K₁^0.75

Where:
  K₁ = K_j / (K_j + K_ℓ)

    Where:
      K_j = E_Ieff / t³
  K_L = 0.585 * ℓ * E_IS‖ / b₁³     (N/m for floor with subfloor only)

    = 0.585 * ℓ * (E_IS‖ + E_Ic + (E_Ac * E_AS‖ / (E_Ac + E_AS‖)) * h₃²) / b₁³
      (N/m for floor with subfloor and topping)

  ℓ     = floor span, m
  E_IS‖ = unit bending stiffness of subfloor in across-span direction, N·m²/m
  E_AS‖ = unit axial stiffness of subfloor in across-span direction, N/m
  h₃    = (t_s + t_c) / 2, m

A.5.4.5.2 Vibration-controlled span —Prefabricated wood I-joist floors

I-joists and a wood-based structural sheathing subfloor may be determined using
a) Clause A.5.4.5.1; or

following conditions:
i) subfloor thickness shall not be greater than 28.5 mm;
ii) the modification factor applied to the effective composite bending stiffness ofthe joist for
multiple-span system shall be 1.2; and
iii) when concrete topping is used, its stiffness contribution shall not be applied.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 11: A.5.4.6 
--------------------------------------------------
A.5.4.6 Building movements due to moisture content change
Most buildings can accommodate small amounts of movement due to moisture content change in wood
members. However, if not considered during design and construction, differential movements can
become visible or even cause structural orserviceability problems. The considerations for differential
movements become more critical for higher buildings due to the cumulative effect of movement.
Shrinkage can contribute to overall lateral drift but can be mitigated using shrinkage compensators and
materials subject to less dimensional change.
Attention should be paid to the following areas to avoid potential shrinkage and swelling-related
problems in the design, where:
a) non-uniform movements could occur;
b) metal connectors are used to support large sawn and glulam timber components;
c) differential movements could cause distress in the finish materials or building envelope; and
d) differential movements could cause distress in plumbing, electrical, and mechanical systems.

Compatibility with other materials should be considered in the design detailing. Assuming similar
members are exposed to the same environmental conditions, itis reasonable to assume the same
degree ofshrinkage or swelling will occur along each load path. Where wood members are exposed to
different environmental conditions (e.g., some members are in aconditioned space while others are in
an unconditioned space), a more detailed analysis is warranted. Similarly, expected movement in non-wood
members, such as contraction or expansion due to temperature changes should be considered.
The shrinkage or swelling of a wood member between the initial and final moisture content may be
estimated using the following equation:

S=D×(Mi –Mf) ×c
where
S =shrinkage orswelling inthe dimension being considered (thickness, width, orlength), mm
D =actual dimension (thickness, width, orlength), mm
Mi =the lesser ofthe initial moisture content orthe fibre saturation point (28%)
Mf =the final moisture content
c =shrinkage coefficient*
For lumber
=0.002 for shrinkage orswelling perpendicular tothe grain
=0.00005 for shrinkage orswelling parallel tothe grain
* More information on shrinkage coefficients for individual wood species can befound in the CWC Wood Design
Manual. For other wood products, refer to published literature.

--------------------------------------------------
A.6.2.1.2 Availability oflumber
The availability oflarge-size and long-length timbers (Beams and Stringers and Posts and Timbers
Grades) should always be confirmed with suppliers prior to specifying. Sizes up to 394 ×394 mm are
generally available in the Douglas Fir-Larch and Hem-Fir species combinations; however, S-P-F and
Northern Species timbers are available only in smaller sizes.
Machine stress-rated lumber and machine evaluated lumber are commonly produced for specialty
applications such aslight-frame trusses and I-joists. Some designers specify machine graded lumber to
take advantage ofthe higher stiffness and strength properties.
The most commonly available grades of machine stress-rated lumber are 1650f-1.5E, 1800f-1.6E,
2100f-1.8E, and 2400f-2.0E; the most common sizes are 38 ×89 mm and 38 ×140 mm. The availability
of other grades and sizes should be confirmed with suppliers prior to specifying.

Except for members designed in accordance with Clause 6.5.12, the following procedure may be used to
determine the factored compressive resistance parallel to grain of members subject to acompressive
stress that is not uniform along its length, either due to concentrated loads or distributed loads:
a) Divide the member into two sections with lengths L1and L2asfollows:
L1=length of member with amaximum factored compressive force Pf1, mm
L2=length of member with amaximum factored compressive force Pf2, mm
such that Pf1 <Pf2
b) Determine the factored compressive resistance parallel to grain, Pr1, ofsection L1in accordance
with Clause 6.5.5.2.4 using L=L1+L2inthe calculation ofKZc.
c) Determine the factored compressive resistance parallel to grain, Pr2, ofsection L2in accordance
with Clause 6.5.5.2.4 using the following formula:
KZc =6.3 (d L’)-0.13<1.3
where
d=dimension in direction ofbuckling (depth or width), mm
L’=L1(Pf1/Pf2)7.9 +L2, mm

--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.6 Compression perpendicular to grain
A relationship between mean compressive strength perpendicular to grain and mean oven-dry wood
density was introduced to establish aconsistent basis for bearing strengths for various products in the
1994 edition ofthis Standard. Itis asfollows:
fcp =0.9L(2243.8G –473.8)/M
where
fcp =specified strength incompression perpendicular to grain, MPa
0.9 =factor applied to obtain alower tolerance limit
L =conversion factor to limit states desing and standard term load duration
    =1.8125
G = mean oven-dry relative density
M = conversion factor for metric units
    = 145.038
Tables 6.8 and 6.9 assign increased compression perpendicular to grain design values to specific grades
of Spruce-Pine-Fir or Hem-Fir machine-graded lumber, which have higher mean density than visually
stress-graded lumber of the same species (see Table A.11).

The NLGA Standard Grading Rules for Canadian Lumber also includes provisions for mills producing any
grade of machine-graded lumber to qualify for other density values based on tests, daily quality control,
and marking the qualified density value on the lumber. In these cases the rules provide for compression
perpendicular values to be based on the marked density value and the formula specified in this Clause,
without the 0.9 tolerance limit.

--------------------------------------------------

Clause 43: A.6.5.12.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.1 Scope Specific truss applications
Fully triangulated —The modified design procedures of Clause 6.5.12* apply only to sawn lumber used
in trusses where all the members form aside of atriangle. In such asystem, abending failure at apanel
point of acompression member would not normally result in collapse ofthe triangle. An attic truss is
not afully triangulated system. Also, the ends oftop chords in top-chord-bearing trusses, and top-chord
overhangs (i.e., outward extensions oftruss chords beyond the panel points) do not fall within the
scope of Clause A.6.5.12 and therefore are not considered part ofthe overall truss length.
*The modified design procedures ofClause 6.5.12 are based onresearch reported in C.Lum, E.Jones, and B. Hintz
(1996).
Clear span limitation —The 12.2 mclear span limitation is consistent with that for snow loading for
National Building Code of Canada Part 9structures (see Subsection 9.4.2). When the 12.2 mspan limit
is exceeded or when other conditions are in effect, an 80% snow load factor shall be used (i.e., the truss
is designed as aPart 4truss). When the 610 mm spacing limit is exceeded, the 80% snow load factor
shall be used and the KHfactor isreduced from 1.1 to 1.0.
Truss configuration —Clause A.6.5.12 limits the applicability of Clause 6.5.12 to roof trusses with
slopes that are similar to those trusses tested. Compared to the standard pitched chord trusses
evaluated in the testing program, very low pitch (less than 2in 12) roof and flat trusses have ahigher
axial force to bending moment ratio and are excluded from coverage in this Standard.
The overall length is alimit that the truss industry has traditionally used to place additional limits on
design. The two limits, 12.2 mclear span and the 18.0 moverall length, provide aboundary between
traditional residential spans and long span roof trusses. Below the 18.0 moverall truss length limit, the
truss may consist ofcantilevers or multiple clear spans, or both, provided that no single span exceeds
12.2 m.
Girder, bowstring, semi-circular, attic, flat, and floor trusses are outside the scope of Clause A.6.5.12.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 44: A.6.5.12.3 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.3 Compressive resistance parallel to grain
Effective length —Recommended effective-length factors are specified in Table A.4. TPIC also provides
recommendations on the effective length oftruss compression members. Factor selection depends on
the load distribution and the type ofstructure.
Compression-chord splices —For strength and deflection calculations, acompression-chord splice may
be considered continuous ifitislocated at aninflection point for the load case being considered. To
allow for changes in lumber length, the splice need only be within ±10% ofthe panel length from the
inflection point. This allowance also recognizes that the location ofthe inflection point will depend on
the loading condition.
Size effects incompression —In most cases, the member length for computing KZcisthe panel length;
between panel points, the axial force changes little compared with changes at the panel points. In cases
where the axial stresses are high relative to the bending stresses, resulting in relatively short panel
lengths, and where the axial forces are relatively constant between adjacent panels, the member length
for computing KZc should include several panels. One-half the chord length between pitch breaks has
been judged to cover these cases.
Note: Apitch break is apoint along the chord analogue line where the slope ofthe chord changes.
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 45: A.6.5.12.4 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.4 Compressive resistance perpendicular to grain
Bearing reinforcement —Bearing reinforcement consists ofapplying truss plates to both sides of a
member that can be subjected to compression perpendicular to grain stresses through the depth ofthe
member. Designs also need to meet the basic bearing requirement of Clause 6.5.6.1.
Note: Testing to support this method ofimproving the bearing resistance is described in Bulmanis, N.S., Latos,
H. A., and Keenan F.J.(1983).
--------------------------------------------------

Clause 46: A.6.5.12.5 
--------------------------------------------------
A.6.5.12.5 Resistance to combined bending and axial load
Amplified moments —The proposed design procedures have been written to cover the general case
where amplified moments are used. Although moment amplification should not be ignored, some
structures can be accurately analyzed without having to use analysis methods that include moment
amplification. An analysis of moment amplification in trusses indicated that mid-panel moments were
more susceptible to P-delta effects, while panel point moments were less susceptible. Furthermore, the
amount of moment amplification calculated is sensitive to the type ofstructure and the analogue
assumptions.
Results from the testing program suggest that the design procedure used by TPIC results in trusses that
exhibit satisfactory levels of performance. The TPIC design approach does not include moment
amplification; however, the procedure does require that the mid-panel deflection be limited. This, in
effect, limits the length oftruss panels, even though the chord member can possess the required
strength. Ifthe deflection limitations in TPIC are not used tolimit panel length, itis possible that the
bending capacity modification factor, KM, from Table 6.19 will not be appropriate.
Bending capacity modification factor, KM —In addition to being afunction ofthe member’s span-to-depth
ratio, the KM factor, calculated from Table 6.19,* also depends on the shape ofthe moment
diagram.
AKMfactor greater than 1generally indicates abending moment distribution with one or more
inflection points in the member between panel points, and apanel point moment that is higher than
the mid-panel moment.

For cases where the mid-panel moment is higher than the panel point moments or where the loading is
such that there are noinflection points inthe panel, the KMfactor isgenerally less than 1.
For other cases where the structural analysis indicates zero moment atthe panel points (i.e., M2 =0),
the bending capacity increase will simply be afunction ofthe span-to-depth ratio. This generally occurs
at pitch breaks or panel point splices, where, although the bending moments are not necessarily zero,
designers traditionally assume apin connection. However, afictitious analogue member, such as that
used to model aheel joint in apitched chord truss, is considered to introduce apanel point moment in
the heel. Therefore, the top chord of aking post truss can be assumed to be continuous over apanel
point atthe heel, but not atthe peak.
The test trusses and trusses analyzed in the impact study, which are considered typical designs, result in
values of KM up to 1.3. The upper limit on KM at 1.3 has been introduced to prevent extrapolation to
higher values.
*The KM factors calculated from Table 6.19 are based on Lau, W., Barrett, J. D., and Lam, F.(1995).
Interaction equation —The modification to the axial ratio term was introduced to recognize the
increase in bending capacity when abrittle material is subjected to axial compression in addition to
bending. The KM factor is used to adjust the bending capacity for various moment configurations in the
top chords.
These two changes to the design of compression chords help to explain the satisfactory levels of safety
observed in the test trusses.
No increase is permitted for combined tension and bending members, asthe testing program was not
designed to evaluate the performance of tension chord members.

A.7.5.5 Standard sizes for glued-laminated timber-GLM
The standard dimensions for glued-laminated timber are asfollows:

b) depths, as calculated for
i)straight or cambered members, in multiples of38 mm; and
ii) members curved to aradius of curvature less than 10 800 mm, in multiples ofthe required
lamination thickness (see Table A.7).
Notes:
1) Commercially available widths can vary.
2)For widths greater than 365 mm, designers should check availability before specifying.

Clause 48: A.8.5.2 
--------------------------------------------------
A.8.5.2 Deflection of CLT panels -Cross laminated Timber (CLT)
The maximum deflection ofaCLT panel, max, may be calculated as the sum of deflections under short-and
long-term loads asfollows:
Δ_max = Δ_ST + Δ_LT * K_creep

Where:
  Δ_ST    = elastic deflection due to short-term and/or standard-term loads, without dead loads in combination
  Δ_LT    = instantaneous elastic deflection due to long-term loads
  K_creep = creep adjustment factor
          = 2.0 for dry-service condition

Deflection under a specified uniformly distributed load, ω, acting perpendicular to the face of a single-span panel
may be calculated as the sum of the deflections due to moment and shear effects using:

- Effective flatwise bending stiffness, (EI)_eff,f
- Effective shear stiffness in flatwise bending, (GA)_eff,f

Formula:
Δ = (5 / 384) * (ω * L⁴ / (EI)_eff,f) + (1 / 8) * (ω * L² / (GA)_eff,f)

For aconcentrated line load, P,located inthe middle ofasingle span CLT panel acting perpendicular to
the panel, the deflection may be calculated as follows:
Δ = (1/48) * (P * L³) / (EI)_eff,f + (1/4) * (P * L) / (GA)_eff,f

Note: Where the shear deformation component ofthe total deformation of CLT panel under out-of-plane standard-term
loading such assnow and live loads issignificant (i.e., in short spans, short span cantilever, etc.) as
determined by the designer, the shear deformation under these loads should be increased by 30% to account for
time-dependent effect associated with rolling shear.

Clause 49: A.8.5.3 
--------------------------------------------------
A.8.5.3 A.8.5.3 Vibration performance ofCLT floors
The allowable span for the control offloor motions caused by walking on aCLT floor may be calculated
using the following equation:

ℓ_v ≤ 0.11 * [(EI)_eff,f / 10⁶]^0.29 / m^0.12

Where:
  ℓ_v        = vibration-controlled span limit, m
  (EI)_eff,f = effective flatwise bending stiffness for a 1 m wide panel, N·mm² (see Clause 8.4.3.2)
  m          = linear mass of CLT for a 1 m wide panel, kg/m

Note: The above equation assumes the floor:
  a) has a single span with both ends simply supported; and
  b) is bare with no topping material.

For multiple-span floors with anon-structural element that is considered to provide enhanced vibration
effect, the calculated vibration-controlled span may beincreased by up to 20%, provided itis not
greater than 8 m.
Notes:
1) The calculation procedure given in this Clause for single-span systems may be applied to individual spans in a
multiple-span system, with adjustment if appropriate.
2) For floors with concrete topping, where the concrete is applied directly tothe CLT panel, this equation may be
used assuming bare floor construction for calculation purposes, i.e., weight ofconcrete isignored in
calculating the mass, m,provided the area density ofthe topping is not greater than twice the bare CLT floor
area density.
3) The current vibration criteria might not address all occupant performance expectations. CLT manufacturer
literature may provide additional span adjustments.

methods ofcalculating such values.
The design values in Table 9.3 for construction sheathing OSB that complies with CSA O325 are
consistent with values developed through in-grade testing and supported by various organizations.
Certification organizations shall ensure that reference values for bending strength and bending stiffness

Clause 53: A.11.7.1 
--------------------------------------------------
A.11.7.1 Deflection of shearwalls in multi-storey buidlings
a) Deflection of blocked shearwall segments:
  The interstorey drift, Δ_i^storey, at the i-th level, mm, may be calculated as follows:
Δ_i^storey = Δ_b,i^storey + Δ_s,i^storey + Δ_n,i^storey + Δ_a,i^storey

Where:
  Δ_b,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to bending
  Δ_s,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to panel shear
  Δ_n,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to nail slip
  Δ_a,i^storey = drift at i-th level due to wall anchorage system elongation

The total deflection Δ_i^total at the i-th level is:

Δ_i^total = Σ_{j=1}^{i} Δ_j^storey

i) Deflection due to bending:
   Δ_b,i^storey = Δ_θ,i + (H_i² / 2) * (θ_i - θ_i-1)

Where:
  θ_i (or θ_j) = change in slope over the i-th storey height:
               = M_i * H_i / (EI)_i

Δ_θ,i = H_i² * q_i / (3 * E_i * I)

Δ_a,i = horizontal distance from top of i-th storey to tangent at the bottom:
       = M_i * H_i² / (2 * E_i * I) + V_i * H_i³ / (3 * E_i * I)

Where:
  H_i = interstorey height of the i-th storey, mm
  V_i = shear force in the i-th storey:
      = Σ_j=1^i F_j = F_1 + F_2 + ... + F_n

  M_i = overturning moment at level i:
      = Σ_j=i+1^n V_j * H_j

  n = total number of stories
  F_j = lateral force at j-th level
  H_j = interstorey height at j-th level

(EI)_i = bending stiffness at the i-th storey:
       = (E * A)_i * (L_s / 2)² * θ² = (EA)_i * t² / 2

Where:
  E = modulus of elasticity at shearwall segment boundary, N/mm²
  A = cross-sectional area of the vertical member, mm²

Ls =length ofshearwall segment, mm
Note: For acontinuous rod system anchored ateach floor level, the effective bending stiffness ofthe
shearwall should be used.

ii) Deflection due to panel shear:
Δ_s,i^storey = Δ_s,i

Where:
  Δ_s,i = v_f,i * H_i / B_v,i

  Where:
    v_f,i = V_i / L_i = maximum shear flow due to specified loads at the top of the wall at the i-th storey, N/mm
    B_v,i = shear-through-thickness rigidity of the sheathing at the i-th storey, N/mm
            (see Tables 9.1 to 9.3 for wood structural panel sheathing)
            For gypsum wallboard, B_v may be taken as 7000 N/mm

iii) Deflection due to sheathing-to-framing connection deformation:
Δ_n,i^storey = Δ_n,i

Where:
  Δ_n,i = 0.0025 * H_i * e_n,i

  Where:
    e_n,i = sheathing-to-framing connection deformation at the i-th storey, mm
            (see Clause A.11.7.1)

iv) Deflection due to elongation in wall anchorage system:
Δ_a,i^storey = H_i * (Σ_{j=i+1}^{n} α_j) = H_i * α_i + H_i * (Σ_{j=1}^{i-1} α_j)

Where:
  α_i = (d_a,i) / L_a

  Where:
    d_a,i = total vertical elongation of the wall anchorage system at the i-th storey
b) Deflection of unblocked shearwall segments:

The interstorey drift of an unblocked shearwall segment with wood structural panels at the i-th storey may be calculated as:

Δ_ub,i^storey = Δ_b,i^storey / J_us,i

Where:
  Δ_ub,i^storey = interstorey drift of a blocked shearwall segment at the i-th level
  J_us,i        = adjustment factor for unblocked shearwall segment at the i-th level

Note: This Clause is appropriate for a typical light-frame wood shearwall cantilevered from its base assuming
the shearwall is stacked for the full height of the building. This is purely a mechanics-based approach to
determine the deflection for a cantilevered single wall acting as a component of the building. There could be
other factors that affect the behaviour of a wall, which should be accounted for by the designer.
