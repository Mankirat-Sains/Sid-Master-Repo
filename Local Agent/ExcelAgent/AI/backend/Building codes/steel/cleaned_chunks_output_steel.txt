3 Definitions and symbols

Section 3.1 - Definitions (Starts on Page 6)
The following definitions apply in this Standard:
Approved — approved by the regulatory authority.
Brace point — the point on a member or element at which it is restrained (see Clause 9).
Camber — the deviation from straightness of a member or any portion of a member with respect to its
major axis.
Note: Frequently, camber is specified and produced in a member to compensate for deflections that occur in the
member when loaded (see Clause 6.3.2). Unspecified camber is sometimes referred to as bow.
24
Concrete — portland cement concrete in accordance with CSA A23.1.
Deck or decking — the structural floor or roof element spanning between adjacent joists and directly
supported thereby.
Note: The terms “deck” and “decking” include cast-in-place or precast concrete slabs, profiled metal deck, wood
plank or plywood, and other relatively rigid elements suitable for floor or roof construction (see Clause 16).
Designer — the engineer responsible for the design.
Erection tolerances — tolerances related to the plumbness, alignment, and level of the piece as a whole.
Note: The deviations are determined by considering the location of the ends of the piece (see Clause 29).
Fabrication tolerances — tolerances allowed from the nominal dimensions and geometry, such as cutting
to length, finishing of ends, cutting of bevel angles, and out-of-straightness such as sweep and camber
for fabricated members (see Clause 28).
Factors —
Importance factor, I — a factor applied severally to loads due to snow and rain, wind, or earthquake
for both the ultimate and serviceability limit states.
Note: It is based on the importance of the structure as defined by its use and occupancy (see Clause 6.2.2).
Load factor, α — a factor, given in Clause 7.2, applied to a specified load for the limit states under
consideration that takes into account the variability of the loads and load patterns and the analysis of
their effects.
Resistance factor, φ — a factor, given in Clause 13.1, applied to a specified material property or the
resistance of a member, connection, or structure that, for the limit state under consideration, takes
into account the variability of material properties, dimensions, quality of work, type of failure, and
uncertainty in prediction of member resistance.
Note: To maintain the simplicity of the design formulas in this Standard, the type of failure and the uncertainty
in prediction of member resistance have been incorporated in the expressions of member resistance (see
Annex B for a more detailed discussion).
Fatigue limit state — the limiting case of the slow propagation of a crack within a structural element that
can result either from live load effects (load-induced fatigue effect) or as the consequence of local
distortion within the structure (distortion-induced fatigue effects).
Firm contact — the condition that exists on a faying surface when plies are solidly seated against each
other but not necessarily in continuous contact (see Clause 23.2).
Inspector — a qualified person who acts for and on behalf of the owner or designer on all inspection and
quality matters within the scope of the contract documents.
Joist shoe — the connection assembly located at the junction of the top chord and the end diagonal that
allows the joist to bear on its support (see Clause 16).
Limit states — those conditions of a structure under which the structure ceases to fulfill the function for
which it was designed.
Fatigue limit states — conditions that concern safety and are related to crack propagation under
cyclic loading.
25
Serviceability limit states — conditions that restrict the intended use and occupancy of the structure
and include deflection, vibration, and permanent deformation.
Ultimate limit states — conditions that concern safety and include overturning, sliding, fracturing,
and exceeding load-carrying capacity.
Loads —
Companion load — a specified variable load that accompanies the principal load in a given load
combination.
Factored load — the product of a specified load and its load factor.
Gravity load (newtons) — a load equal to the mass of the object (kilograms) being supported
multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, g (9.81 m/s2).
Notional lateral load — a fictitious lateral load, as given in Clause 8.4, that allows the stability of the
frame, with failure modes involving in-plane bending, to be computed based on the actual length
(K = 1) for beam-columns.
Principal load — the specified variable load or rare load that dominates in a given load combination.
Specified loads (D, E, H, L, L–c, C, Cd, CT, P, S, T, and W) — those loads prescribed by the regulatory
authority (see Clause 6.2.1).
Mill tolerances — variations allowed from the nominal dimensions and geometry with respect to cross-
sectional area, non-parallelism of flanges, and out-of-straightness such as sweep or camber in the
product as manufactured and given in CSA G40.20.
Modulus of elasticity of concrete — the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic range of a stress-strain
curve for concrete and, with density, γc, between 1500 and 2500 kg/m3, is taken as follows:
For normal density concrete with compressive strength, f′c, between 20 and 40 MPa, the modulus of
elasticity may be taken as follows:
Pass through force — a load or force defined by the Structural Designer that must be accommodated in
the design of the structural member(s) and the connections between those designated members in
addition to those loads and forces normally associated in the member and connection design of each
individual interconnecting member.
Protected zone — areas of members in a seismic force resisting system that undergo large inelastic
strains and in which limitations apply to fabrication and attachments. See Clause 27.1.9.
Regulatory authority — a federal, provincial/territorial, or municipal ministry, department, board,
agency, or commission that is responsible for regulating by statute the use of products, materials, or
services.
26
Resistance —
Factored resistance, ϕR — the product of the nominal resistance and the appropriate resistance
factor.
Nominal resistance, R — the nominal resistance of a member, connection, or structure as calculated
in accordance with this Standard and based on the specified material properties and nominal
dimensions.
Segmented member — a member with a constant cross-section when axial loads are applied between in-
plane lateral supports or frame connections, and a member with cross-section changes between in-plane
lateral supports or frame connections.
Seismic design storey drift — the storey drift obtained from the lateral deflections obtained from a
linear elastic analysis multiplied by RdRo/Ie (see Clause 27).
Snug-tightness — the condition that exists when all of the plies in a connection have been pulled into
firm contact by the bolts in the joint and all of those bolts remain tightened sufficiently to prevent the
removal of the nuts without the use of a wrench (see Clause 23).
Span of an open-web steel joist — the centre-to-centre distance of joist bearings or shoes (see
Clause 16).
Sweep — the deviation from straightness of a member or any portion of a member with respect to its
minor axis.

have at least one end connected to a column to facilitate erection.
Truss — a triangulated framework loaded primarily in flexure (see Clause 15).

6 Design requirements

Section 6.1.1 - Limit states (Starts on Page 19)
Steel structures designed in accordance with this Standard shall be safe from collapse during
construction and designed to be safe and serviceable during the useful life of the structure. Limit states
define the various types of collapse and unserviceability that are to be avoided. Those concerning safety
are called the ultimate limit states (strength, overturning, sliding, and fracture) or the fatigue limit state
(crack propagation) and those concerning serviceability are called the serviceability limit states
(deflections, vibration, and permanent deformation). The object of limit states design calculations is to
keep the probability of reaching a limit state below a certain value previously established for the given
type of structure. This is achieved in this Standard by the use of load factors applied to the specified
loads (see Article 4.1.2.1 of the National Building Code of Canada [NBCC]) and resistance factors applied
to the specified resistances (see Clause 13 and Annex B of this Standard).
The various limit states are specified in Clause 6. Some of these relate to the specified loads and others
to the factored loads. Camber, provisions for expansion and contraction, and corrosion protection are
37
further design requirements related to serviceability and durability. All limit states shall be considered in
the design.

Section 6.1.2 - Structural integrity (Starts on Page 20)
The general arrangement of the structural system and the connection of its members shall be designed
to provide resistance to disproportionate collapse as a consequence of local failure. The requirements of

shall be investigated.

Section 6.3.3.2 -  (Starts on Page 21)

Section 8.1 - General (Starts on Page 23)
In proportioning the structure to meet the design requirements of Clause 6, the methods of analysis
specified in Clause 8 shall be used. The distribution of internal forces and bending moments shall be
determined both under the specified loads to satisfy the requirements of serviceability and fatigue
specified in Clause 6 and under the factored loads to satisfy strength and overturning requirements
specified in Clause 7.

Section 8.2.1 - General (Starts on Page 23)
Three basic types of construction and associated design assumptions, i.e.,“rigidly connected”, “simple”,
and “semi-rigid” (see Clauses 8.2.2 to 8.2.4) may be used for all or part of a structure under this
Standard. The distribution of internal forces and bending moments throughout the structure shall
depend on the type or types of construction chosen and the forces to be resisted.
41

Section 8.2.2 - Rigidly connected and continuous construction (Starts on Page 24)
In this construction, the beams, girders, and trusses are rigidly connected to other frame members or are
continuous over supports. Connections shall be generally designed to resist the bending moments and
internal forces calculated by assuming that the angles between intersecting members remain unchanged
as the structure is loaded.

Section 8.2.3 - Simple construction (Starts on Page 24)
Simple construction assumes that the ends of beams, girders, and trusses are free to rotate under load in
the plane of loading. Resistance to lateral loads, including stability effects, shall be ensured by a suitable
system of bracing or plate walls or by the design of part of the structure as rigidly connected or semi-
rigid construction.

Section 8.2.4.1 -  (Starts on Page 24)
In this construction, the angles between connected members change under applied bending moments
and redistribute the moments between members while maintaining sufficient capacity to resist lateral
loads and to provide adequate stability of the framework in accordance with Clause 8.4.

The design and construction of semi-rigid frameworks shall meet the following requirements:
a)
The positive and negative moment/rotation response of the connections up to their maximum
capacity shall have been established by test and either published in the technical literature or be
available from a reputable testing facility.

connections.
c)
Consideration shall be given to the effects of repeated vertical and horizontal loading and load
reversals, with particular regard to incremental strain in connections and low-cycle fatigue.

Section 8.3.1 - Elastic analysis (Starts on Page 24)
Under a particular loading combination, the forces and moments throughout all or part of the structure
may be determined by an analysis that assumes that individual members behave elastically.

Section 8.3.2 - Plastic analysis (Starts on Page 24)
Under a particular loading combination, the forces and moments throughout all or part of the structure
may be determined by a plastic analysis, provided that
a)

under factored loads at the splice location or 0.25Mp, whichever is greater;
f)
members are not subject to repeated heavy impact or fatigue; and
42
g)
the influence of inelastic deformation on the strength of the structure is taken into account (see
Clause 8.4).

Section 8.4.1 -  (Starts on Page 25)
The translational load effects produced by notional lateral loads, applied at each storey, equal to 0.005
times the factored gravity loads contributed by that storey, shall be added to the lateral loads for each
load combination. The notional lateral loads shall be applied in both orthogonal directions independently
when the three-dimensional effects of loading are included in the analysis of the structure.

Section 8.4.2 -  (Starts on Page 25)
The analyses referred to in Clause 8.3 shall include the sway effects in each storey produced by the
vertical loads acting on the structure in its displaced configuration. The second-order effects that are due
to the relative translational displacement (sway) of the ends of a member shall be determined from a
second-order analysis. Elastic second-order effects may be accounted for by amplifying translational load
effects obtained from a first-order elastic analysis by the factor

adjacent lateral-load-resisting elements; and
d)
resist torsional effects.
See also Clause 8.4.

Section 9.2.1 - Initial misalignment at brace point (Starts on Page 25)

Section 9.2.2 - Displacement of bracing systems (Starts on Page 25)
The displacement of the bracing system at the brace point, Δb, is the sum of the brace deformation, the

brace force and any other forces acting on the brace and shall be calculated in the direction
perpendicular to the braced member at the brace point.

Bracing systems, including bracing members and their connections and supports, shall be proportioned to
resist the forces that develop at the brace points and limit the lateral displacement of the brace points.
Bracing for beams shall provide lateral restraint to the compression flange, except that at cantilevered
ends of beams and beams subject to double curvature, the restraint shall be provided at both top and
bottom flanges unless otherwise accounted for in the design.

Section 9.2.4 - Twisting and lateral displacements (Starts on Page 26)
Twisting and lateral displacements shall be prevented at the supports of a member or element unless

Any other forces acting on the bracing member shall also be taken into account. The displacement Δb
shall not exceed Δo.

Section 9.2.6.1 - Second-order method (Starts on Page 26)
Forces acting in the member bracing system and its deformations shall be determined by means of a
second-order elastic analysis of the member and its bracing system. This analysis shall include the most
critical initial deformed configuration of the member and shall consider forces due to external loads. In
the analysis, hinges may be assumed at brace points in the member or element being braced.
The displacement Δb shall not exceed Δo unless a greater value can be justified by analysis.

Section 9.2.6.2 - Direct method (Starts on Page 26)
Unless a second-order analysis is carried out in accordance with Clause 9.2.6.1 or a simplified analysis is
carried out in accordance with Clause 9.2.5, bracing systems shall be proportioned at each brace point to
have a factored resistance in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the braced member
in the plane of buckling equal to at least

When bracing of the compression flange is effected by a slab or deck, the slab or deck and the means by
which the calculated bracing forces are transmitted between the flange or chord and the slab or deck
shall be adequate to resist a force in the plane of the slab or deck. This force, which shall be taken as at

Section 10.1 - Simple span flexural members (Starts on Page 27)
Beams, girders, and trusses may be designed on the basis of simple spans, whose length may be taken as
the distance between the centres of gravity of supporting members. Alternatively, the span length of
beams and girders may be taken as the actual length of such members measured between centres of end
connections. The length of trusses designed as simple spans may be taken as the distance between the
extreme working points of the system of triangulation employed. The design of columns or other
supporting members shall provide for the effect of any significant moment or eccentricity arising from
the manner in which a beam, girder, or truss is connected or supported.

Section 10.2 - Continuous span flexural members (Starts on Page 28)

of the supported beam, girder, or truss.

Section 10.3.1 - General (Starts on Page 28)
A member in compression shall be designed on the basis of its effective length, KL (the product of the

Unless otherwise specified in this Standard, the unbraced length, L, shall be taken as the length of the
compression member between the centres of restraining members. The unbraced length may differ for
different cross-sectional axes of a compression member. At the bottom storey of a multi-storey structure
or for a single-storey structure, L shall be taken as the length from the top of the base plate to the centre
of restraining members at the next higher level.
The effective length factor, K, depends on the potential failure modes, whether by bending in-plane or
buckling, as specified in Clauses 10.3.2 and 10.3.3.
Note: See also Clause 9 on the effectiveness of the brace or support point.

Section 10.3.2 - Failure mode involving bending in-plane (Starts on Page 28)
The effective length shall be taken as the actual length (K = 1.0) for beam-columns that would fail by in-
plane bending, provided that, when applicable, the sway effects, including notional load effects, are
included in the analysis of the structure to determine the end moments and forces acting on the beam-
columns.

Section 10.3.3 - Failure mode involving buckling (Starts on Page 28)
The effective length for axially loaded columns that would fail by buckling and for beam-columns that
would fail by out-of-plane (lateral-torsional) buckling shall be based on the rotational and translational
restraint afforded at the ends of the unbraced length (see Annexes F and G).

Section 10.4.1 - General (Starts on Page 28)
The slenderness ratio of a member in compression shall be taken as the ratio of the effective length, KL,
to the corresponding radius of gyration, r. The slenderness ratio of a member in tension shall be taken as
the ratio of the unbraced length, L, to the corresponding radius of gyration.

Section 10.4.2.1 -  (Starts on Page 28)
The slenderness ratio of a member in compression shall not exceed 200.

Section 10.4.2.2 -  (Starts on Page 29)
Except as specified in Clauses 15.2.7 and 16.5.6.1, the slenderness ratio of a member in tension shall not
exceed 300. This limit may be waived if other means are provided to control flexibility, sag, vibration, and
slack in a manner commensurate with the service conditions of the structure or if it can be shown that
such factors are not detrimental to the performance of the structure or of the assembly of which the
member is a part.

The following definitions apply in Clause 17:
Cover slab — the concrete above the flutes of the steel deck. All flutes are filled with concrete so as to
form a ribbed slab.
Effective cover slab thickness — the minimum thickness of concrete measured from the top of the slab
to the top of the steel deck.
Effective slab thickness — the overall slab thickness, provided that the slab is cast
a)
with a flat underside;
b)
on corrugated steel forms having a height of corrugation not greater than 0.25 times the overall slab
thickness; or
87
c)

times the minimum width of concrete ribs.
In all other cases,“effective slab thickness” means the overall slab thickness minus the height of the
corrugation or the flute .
Flute — the portion of the steel deck that forms a valley.
Rib — the portion of the concrete slab that is formed by the flute.

In lieu of tests or analysis, the effects of partial shear connection and interfacial slip, creep, and shrinkage
may be assessed as follows:

shall be calculated using an effective moment of inertia given by
Ie = Is + 0.85p0.25(It – Is)

based on the cross-sectional areas of the top and bottom chords by 15% or by a more
detailed analysis
p
= fraction of full shear connection
= 1.00 for full shear connection
It
= transformed moment of inertia of composite beam based on the modular ratio n = E/Ec
b)
for creep, elastic deflections caused by dead loads and long-term live loads, as calculated in Item a),
need to be increased by 15%; and
88
c)
for shrinkage of concrete, using a selected free shrinkage strain, strain compatibility between the
steel and concrete, and an age-adjusted effective modulus of elasticity of concrete as it shrinks and
creeps, the deflection of a simply supported composite beam, joist, or truss shall be calculated as
follows:
where
L
= span of the beam, joist, or truss
ψ
= curvature along length of the beam, joist, or truss due to shrinkage of concrete
c
= empirical coefficient used to match theory with test results (accounting for cracking of concrete in
tension, the non-linear stress-strain relationship of concrete, and other factors)
εf

Ac
= effective area of concrete slab
y
= distance from centroid of effective area of concrete slab to centroidal axis of the composite beam,
joist, or truss
ns
= modular ratio, E/E'c

E'c
= Ec/(1+χϕ)
= age-adjusted effective modulus of elasticity of concrete
where
χ
= aging coefficient of concrete
ϕ
= creep coefficient of concrete
Ies
= Is + 0.85p0.25(Its – Is)

Components of built-up members shall be joined for the applied forces and other minimum connection
requirements specified in this Clause.
Note: The use of fillet welds or partial penetration welds, instead of complete joint penetration welds, is
encouraged. If undermatching is permitted per CSA W59, this also needs to be considered. This will provide better
ductility, improve fracture resistance, minimize lamellar tearing, and minimize distortion of the overall built-up
section.
102

Section 19.2.1 -  (Starts on Page 85)
All components of built-up compression members and the transverse spacing of their lines of connecting
bolts or welds shall meet the requirements of Clauses 10 and 11.

Compression members composed of two or more shapes in contact or separated from one another shall
be interconnected in such a way that the slenderness ratio of any component, based on its least radius of

Battens shall have a length of not less than the distance between lines of bolts or welds connecting them
to the main components of the member and shall have a thickness of not less than 1/60 of this distance
if the batten consists of a flat plate. Battens and their connections shall be proportioned to resist the
following simultaneously:

20 Plate walls

Section 20.1.1 - Definition (Starts on Page 88)
A plate wall is a lateral-force-resisting structural system consisting of a framework of columns and beams,
with relatively thin infill plates in the plane of the frame connected all around to the surrounding
members. Frame connections between the beams and columns may be moment-resisting or simple shear
connections.

Section 20.1.2 - Lateral resistance (Starts on Page 88)
Lateral storey shears are considered to be carried by a combination of frame action, if applicable, and
post-buckling tension fields that develop in the infill plates parallel to the direction of the principal tensile
stresses. Axial forces and moments develop in the beams and columns of plate walls as a result of the
a)
response of the wall to the overall bending and shear; and
b)
tension field action in the adjacent infill plates.

meeting the requirements of Clause 20.5.2.

Section 20.9.2 -  (Starts on Page 90)
At the bottom panel, the vertical component of the infill plate tension field shall be anchored by

21 Connections

Section 21.1 - Alignment of members (Starts on Page 91)
Axially-loaded members that meet at a joint shall have their centroidal axes intersect at a common point
if practicable. Bending resulting from joint eccentricity shall be taken into account.

Section 21.2 - Unrestrained members (Starts on Page 91)
Except as otherwise indicated in the structural design documents, all connections of beams, girders, and
trusses shall be designed and detailed as flexible and ordinarily may be proportioned for the reaction
shears only. Flexible beam connections shall accommodate end rotations of unrestrained (simple) beams.
To accomplish this, inelastic action at the specified load levels in the connection is permitted.

Section 21.3 - Restrained members (Starts on Page 91)
When beams, girders, or trusses are subject to both reaction shear and end moment due to full or partial
end restraint or to continuous or cantilever construction, their connections shall be designed for the
combined effect of shear, bending, and axial load.
When beams are rigidly framed to the flange of an I-shaped column and the distance from the end of the
column to the top flange of the beam is greater than the depth of the column, stiffeners shall be
provided on the column web if the following bearing and tensile resistances of the column are exceeded:
a)
opposite the compression flange of the beam:
except when the column has a Class 3 or 4 web, in which case the following shall apply:
b)
opposite the tension flange of the beam when the connected element is
i)
welded to the column:
ii)
bolted to the column with two rows of bolts centered about the web of column and the
tension flange of the beam:
where
wc
= thickness of column web
tb
= thickness of beam flange
tc

e is not to be taken as greater than
109

Stiffeners shall also be provided on the web of columns, beams, or girders if Vr calculated from
Clause 13.4.2 is exceeded, in which case the stiffener or stiffeners shall transfer a shear force, Vst, equal
to
Vf – 0.8ϕAwFs
The stiffeners shall be connected so that the force in the stiffener is transferred through the stiffener
connection. When beams frame to one side of the column only, the stiffeners need not be longer than
one-half of the depth of the column. When an axial tension or compression force is acting on the beam,
its effects (additive only) shall be considered in the design of the stiffeners.
When beams are rigidly framed to the flange of an I-shaped column and the distance from the end of the
column to the top flange of the beam is less than or equal to the depth of the column, the requirement
of stiffeners shall be evaluated by rational analysis. In lieu of rational analysis, stiffeners shall be
provided.

Section 21.4 - Connections of tension or compression members (Starts on Page 92)
The connections at ends of compression members not finished to bear or of tension members shall be

level of structural integrity (see Clauses 6.1.2, 28.5, and 29.3.9). The flanges of single web members shall
be connected.

Section 21.6 - Lamellar tearing (Starts on Page 92)
Corner or T-joint details of rolled structural members or plates involving transfer of tensile forces in the
through-thickness direction resulting from shrinkage due to welding executed under conditions of

taken to address the possibility of lamellar tearing.

Section 21.7 - Placement of fasteners and welds (Starts on Page 92)
Except in members subject to fatigue (see Clause 26) and in braces subject to seismic loads (see
Clause 27.5.4.1),disposition of fillet welds to balance the forces about the neutral axis or axes for end
connections of single-angle, double-angle, or similar types of axially loaded members shall not be
required. Eccentricity between the centroidal axes of such members and the gauge lines of bolted end
connections may also be neglected. In axially loaded members subject to fatigue, the fasteners or welds
in end connections shall have their centroid on the centroidal axis of the member unless provision is
made for the effect of the resulting eccentricity.

When load-carrying fasteners pass through fillers with a total thickness greater than 19 mm, the fillers
shall be extended beyond the splice material and the filler extension shall be secured by sufficient
fasteners to distribute the total force in the connected element uniformly over the combined cross-
section of the connected element and the filler. , If the filler extension is not provided and/or the filler is
not secured by sufficient fasteners, an equivalent number of fasteners shall be included in the
connection.

Section 21.8.1.2 -  (Starts on Page 93)

In welded construction, any filler with a total thickness greater than 6 mm shall extend beyond the edges
of the splice plate and shall be welded to the part on which it is fitted with sufficient weld to transmit
the splice plate load, applied at the surface of the filler, as an eccentric load. Welds that connect the
splice plate to the filler shall be sufficient to transmit the splice plate load and shall be long enough to
avoid overloading the filler along the toe of the weld. Any filler that is 6 mm or less in thickness shall
have its edges made flush with the edges of the splice plate and the required weld size shall be equal to
the thickness of the filler plate plus the size necessary to transmit the splice plate load.

progressing systematically from the most rigid part of the joint to its free edges (re-snugging may be
necessary in large joints).
c)
When all bolts are snug-tight, each bolt in the joint shall be pretensioned, with pretensioning

shall be pretensioned.

Section 23.8.1 -  (Starts on Page 99)
The inspector shall determine that the requirements of Clauses 23.1 to 23.6 are met. Tensioning of bolts
shall be observed during their installation to ascertain that the proper procedures are employed. In
addition, the following shall apply:

of the concrete

Section 25.3.5 - Anchor rods in tension and bending (Starts on Page 101)
An anchor rod required to develop resistance to both tension and bending shall be proportioned to meet
the requirements of Clause 13.9.1. The tensile and moment resistances,Tr and Mr, shall be based on the

Base plate holes may be drilled, machined, or thermally cut. The surfaces of thermally cut holes shall
meet the requirements of Clause 28.2.
Holes in base plates for anchor rods shall be of sufficient size to meet or exceed the placement
tolerances for anchor rods. The Designer shall provide details of corrective work if base plate holes are to

by the designer.
26 Fatigue

Section 26.1 - General (Starts on Page 102)
In addition to meeting the fatigue requirements of Clause 26, all members and connections shall meet
the requirements for the static load conditions using the factored loads. Specified loads shall be used for
all fatigue calculations. This is calculated using ordinary elastic analysis and the principles of mechanics of
materials and includes stresses that may result from bending moments due to joint eccentricities. A
specified load less than the maximum specified load but acting with a greater number of cycles can
govern and therefore shall be considered. Members and connections subjected to fatigue loading shall
120
be designed, detailed, and fabricated so as to minimize stress concentrations and abrupt changes in
cross-section. The life of the structure shall be taken as 50 years, unless otherwise specified by the
owner.

Section 26.2 - Proportioning (Starts on Page 103)
In the absence of more specific requirements by the owner or designer, the requirements of Clause 26
shall be used to proportion members and parts. Fatigue resistance shall be provided only for repetitive
loads.

Section 26.3.1 - Calculation of stress range (Starts on Page 103)
The controlling stress feature in load-induced fatigue is the range of stress to which the element is
subjected. This is calculated using ordinary elastic analysis and the principles of mechanics of materials
and includes stresses that may result from the bending moments due to joint eccentricities. More
sophisticated analysis shall be required only in cases not covered by Table 9, e.g., major access holes and
cut-outs. Stress range is the algebraic difference between the maximum stress and minimum stress at a
given location; thus, only live load induces a stress range.
The load-induced fatigue requirements of Clause 26 need be applied only at locations that undergo a net
applied tensile stress. Stress ranges that are completely in compression need not be investigated for
fatigue.

Section 26.3.2 - Design criteria (Starts on Page 103)
For load-induced fatigue and constant amplitude fatigue loading, the following design requirement shall
apply:
Fsr ≥fsr
where
Fsr
= fatigue resistance
=
=
where
γ and γ'
= fatigue life constants (see Clause 26.3.4)
n
= number of stress range cycles at given detail for each application of load
N
= number of applications of load
Fsrt
= constant amplitude threshold stress range (Clauses 26.3.3 and 26.3.4)
fsr
= calculated stress range at the detail due to passage of the fatigue load including stresses
due to eccentricities

Section 26.3.3 - Cumulative fatigue damage (Starts on Page 103)
The total damage that results from variable amplitude fatigue loading shall satisfy
121
where
(nN)i = number of expected stress range cycles at stress range level i, Fsri
Nfi
= number of cycles that would cause failure Fsri, obtained from Figure 1 for the appropriate fatigue
category. Alternatively, it may be calculated as follows:
Nfi= γ Fsri–3 for Fsri ≥Fsrt
and
Nfi = γ‘Fsri–5 for Fsri ≤Fsrt
The summation shall include both stress cycles above and below Fsrt.
The fatigue constant γ' shall be as specified in Table 10.

Section 26.3.4 - Fatigue constants and detail categories (Starts on Page 104)
The fatigue constants γ, γ', nN', and Fsrt shall be as specified in Table 10 and shown in Figure 1. The detail
categories shall be obtained from Table 9 and are illustrated in Figure 2.
For high-strength bolts, see also Clause 13.12.1.3.

Section 26.3.5 - Limited number of cycles (Starts on Page 104)
Except for fatigue-sensitive details with high stress ranges (probably with stress reversal), special
considerations beyond those specified in Clause 26.1 need not apply in the event that the number of
stress range cycles, nN, over the life of the structure, expected to be applied at a given detail, is less than
the greater of
.

Section 26.4.1 -  (Starts on Page 104)
Members and connections shall be detailed to minimize distortion-induced fatigue that can occur in
regions of high strain at the interconnection of members undergoing differential displacements.
Whenever practicable, all components that make up the cross-section of the primary member shall be
fastened to the interconnection member.

Section 26.4.2 -  (Starts on Page 104)
Plate girders with
shall not be used under fatigue conditions.

Section 26.5 - High-strength bolts (Starts on Page 104)
A high-strength bolt subjected to tensile cyclic loading shall be pretensioned to the minimum preload
specified in Clause 23.7. Connected parts shall be arranged so that prying forces are minimized. The
prying force per bolt shall not exceed 30% of the externally applied load.
The permissible maximum applied nominal axial stress, including amplification by prying under specified
loads, based on the nominal area of the bolt, shall not exceed 214 MPa for ASTM A325, ASTM A325M,
and ASTM F1852 bolts and 262 MPa for ASTM A490, ASTM A490M, and ASTM F2280 bolts.
The total maximum cyclic service load that may be applied to a bolt is calculated as the product of the
permissible maximum nominal stress above and the nominal area of a bolt. Thus calculated, the service
load per bolt, including the amplification by prying, shall not exceed this maximum applied service load
on a pretensioned bolt.
122
27 Seismic design

Section 27.1.1 - Scope (Starts on Page 105)
Clause 27 specifies requirements for the design of members and connections in the seismic-force-
resisting system of steel-framed building structures. With the exception of Clause 27.11, Clause 27
applies to buildings for which seismic design loads are based on a ductility-related force modification
factor, Rd, greater than 1.5. Clause 27 shall be applied with the requirements of the NBCC. Alternatively,
the maximum anticipated seismic loads may be determined from non-linear time-history analyses using
appropriate structural models and ground motions. Height restrictions shall not apply when the seismic
forces are determined from non-linear time-history analyses or to buildings with specified short-period
spectral acceleration ratios (IEFaSa(0.2)) less than 0.35, unless otherwise specified in Clause 27 or the
NBCC.
Clause 27 may be applied to structures other than building structures provided that the structure

30 Inspection

Section 30.1 - General (Starts on Page 140)
Material and quality of work shall at all times be subject to inspection by qualified inspectors who
represent and are responsible to the designer. The inspection shall cover shop work and field erection
work to ensure compliance with this Standard.

Section 30.2 - Co-operation (Starts on Page 140)
Insofar as possible, all inspections shall be made in the fabricator's shop. The fabricator shall co-operate
with the inspector and permit access for inspection to all places where work is being done. The inspector
shall co-operate in avoiding undue delay in the fabrication or erection of the steelwork.

Section 30.3 - Rejection (Starts on Page 140)
Material or quality of work not meeting the requirements of this Standard may be rejected at any time
during the progress of work once non-compliance is established.

Section 30.4 - Inspection of high-strength bolted joints (Starts on Page 140)
The inspection of high-strength bolted joints shall be performed in accordance with Clause 23.8.

Section 30.5 - Third-party welding inspection (Starts on Page 140)
When third-party welding inspection (visual and/or NDE) is specified by the owner, the welding
inspection shall be performed by firms certified to CSA W178.1, except that visual inspection may also be
performed by persons certified to Level 2 or 3 of CSA W178.2.

Section 30.6 - Identification of steel by marking (Starts on Page 140)
In the fabricator’s plant, steel used for main components shall at all times be marked to identify its
specification (and grade, if applicable). This shall be done by suitable markings or by recognized colour
coding, except that cut pieces identified by piece mark and contract number need not continue to carry
specification identification markings when it has been satisfactorily established that such cut pieces meet
the required material specifications.
