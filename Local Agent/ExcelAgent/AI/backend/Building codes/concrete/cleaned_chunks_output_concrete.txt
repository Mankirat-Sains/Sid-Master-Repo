Section 8.2.1 - General (Starts on Page 56)
Loads shall be determined in accordance with the requirements of the applicable building code.

Section 8.2.2.1 - General (Starts on Page 56)
The short-term and long-term forces and effects resulting from the interaction of the stiffness of the

Imposed deformations can require considerable redistribution of internal forces, which can lead to excessive
cracking at service load or to brittle failure.
3)
Estimates of differential settlement, creep, shrinkage, or temperature change should be based on realistic
assessments of such effects occurring in service. The magnitude of the internal forces and the effects of
imposed deformations depend on the magnitude of the deformation, the stiffness of the structure (cracked or
uncracked) resisting the deformations, and the time necessary for the deformations to occur.

Section 9.4 - Analysis by strut-and-tie models (Starts on Page 62)
Strut-and-tie models satisfying the requirements of Clause 11.4 may be used to determine the internal
force effects, proportion the reinforcement, and confirm the concrete dimensions.
Note: Such models are particularly appropriate in regions where plane sections do not remain plane.

Section 9.5.1 - Finite element analysis or other numerical techniques may be used to determine load effects, provided (Starts on Page 62)

that the differences between the behaviour of the structure and the behaviour assumed in the analysis
are accounted for.
Note: The analysis should account for the effects of cracking. If the effects of cracking are not included, the
redistribution of stresses due to the anticipated cracking and the effects of this redistribution on the reinforcement
layout should be explicitly considered in the design of the reinforcement.

Section 9.5.2 - Mesh patterns and boundary conditions shall be consistent with geometry, loading, and restraint (Starts on Page 63)

for structural low-density concrete and structural semi-low-density concrete, the values shall be
multiplied by (1.65 – 0.0003γc), but not less than 1.0, where γc is the density in kilograms per cubic
metre; and
b)
for fy other than 400 MPa, the values shall be multiplied by (0.4 + fy/670).

Section 9.8.2.2 - Immediate deflections (Starts on Page 64)
When deflections are to be computed, deflections that occur immediately on application of load shall
be computed by methods or formulas for elastic deflections, taking into consideration the effects of
cracking and reinforcement on member stiffness.
Note: Deflections may be calculated using formulas for elastic deflections based on effective moments of inertia as
specified in Clauses 9.8.2.3 to 9.8.2.5, or by methods based on the integration of curvatures at sections along the
span.

Section 9.8.2.3 - Ec and Ie (Starts on Page 64)
Unless deflections are determined by a more comprehensive analysis, immediate deflection shall be
computed using elastic deflection equations; a modulus of elasticity, Ec, for concrete as specified in
Clause 8.6.2; and the effective moment of inertia, as follows:
📐 Equation 9.1
reproduction interdite.
where
📐 Equation 9.2
📐 and fr shall be taken as half the value given in Equation 8.3.
Note: Depending on the shoring and reshoring schedule adopted, the maximum Ma may occur during construction.
If construction loadings are unknown, Ma may be computed as the maximum moment due to specified dead and
live loads for the computation of instantaneous and long-term deflections.

Section 9.8.2.4 - Moment of inertia for continuous spans (Starts on Page 65)
For continuous prismatic members, the effective moment of inertia may be taken as the weighted
📐 average of the values obtained from Equation 9.1 for the critical positive and negative moment
sections, as follows:
a)
two ends continuous:
📐 Equation 9.3
b)
one end continuous:
📐 Equation 9.4

Section 9.8.2.5 - Sustained load deflections (Starts on Page 65)
Unless values are obtained by a more comprehensive analysis, the total immediate plus long-term
deflection for flexural members shall be obtained by multiplying the immediate deflection caused by
the sustained load considered by the factor ζs, as follows:
📐 Equation 9.5
where
ρ′I
=I the value at midspan for simple and continuous spans and at the support for cantilevers
The time dependent factor, s, for sustained loads, applied when the concrete reaches an age of 28 days
or greater, shall be taken to be equal to the following values:
- For loads sustained for five years or more

Section 1.0 - Note: When a sustained load is applied when the concrete is less than 28 days old, the immediate plus long-term (Starts on Page 65)
📐 deflection may exceed that computed using Equation 9.5. For concrete loaded at an age between 7 and 28 days,
the additional long-term deflection may be estimated by multiplying ζs by the factor [1.6 – 0.6 (t – 7)/21] where t is
the concrete age, in days, at the time of loading.

Deflection control of two-way slab systems shall be checked using Clause 13.2.

For partially prestressed members [i.e., members not satisfying Clause 18.3.2 c)], the reduction in
sectional stiffness caused by cracking shall be taken into account.

Section 9.8.4.4 - Sustained load deflections (Starts on Page 66)
The additional long-term deflection of prestressed concrete members shall be computed by taking into
account stresses in concrete and steel under sustained load, including effects of creep and shrinkage of
concrete and relaxation of steel.

Section 9.8.4.5 - Deflection limits (Starts on Page 66)
The computed deflection shall not exceed the limits specified in Table 9.3.

Section 9.8.5.1 - Shored construction (Starts on Page 66)
If composite flexural members are supported during construction so that after removal of temporary
supports the dead load is resisted by the full composite section, the composite member may be
considered equivalent to a monolithically cast member for the computation of deflection. For non-
prestressed composite members containing more than one type of concrete, the portion of the member
in compression shall determine whether the values specified in Table 9.2 for normal density or low-
density concrete shall apply. If deflection is computed, account shall be taken of curvatures resulting
from differential shrinkage of precast and cast-in-place components and of axial creep effects in a
prestressed concrete member.

Section 9.8.5.2 - Unshored construction (Starts on Page 66)
If the thickness of a non-prestressed precast flexural member meets the requirements of Table 9.2,
deflection need not be computed. If the thickness of a non-prestressed composite member meets the
requirements of Table 9.2, deflection occurring after the member becomes composite need not be
computed, but the long-term deflection of the precast member should be investigated for magnitude
and duration of load before the beginning of effective composite action.

directions of the principal tensile membrane forces. Where this is not practical, membrane
reinforcement may be placed in two or more directions.
Note: If the direction of reinforcement varies more than 15° from the direction of principal tensile membrane force,
it is possible that the amount of reinforcement will have to be increased to limit the width of possible cracks under
specified loads.

Section 19.4.7 - When the magnitude of the principal tensile membrane stress within the shell varies greatly over the (Starts on Page 159)
area of the shell surface, reinforcement resisting the total tension may be concentrated in the regions
of largest tensile stress if it can be shown that this provides a safe basis for design. However, the ratio of

20 Strength evaluation procedures
Notes:
1)
This Clause specifies requirements and procedures for evaluating the strength or safe load rating of structures
or structural elements where
a)
doubt exists about their adequacy because of apparent or suspected deficiencies or defects;
b)
the strength or load-bearing capacity is unknown;
c)
a change of function creates loading characteristics different from those provided for in the design of
the structure; or
d)
damage that has possibility reduced the strength or load-bearing capacity has occurred.
2)
If the structure under investigation does not meet the requirements specified in Clause 20.2.3, 20.3.1.10, or
20.3.2.1, a lower load rating for the structure based on the results of the load test or analysis may be
assigned.

Section 20.1 - General (Starts on Page 160)
When the safety of a structure or structural member is in doubt and a structural strength investigation
is necessary, it shall be carried out by analysis, by means of load tests, or by a combination of these
methods.

Section 20.2.1 - If the strength evaluation is performed by analytical means, a thorough field investigation of the (Starts on Page 160)
dimensions and details of the members as actually built, of the properties of the materials, and of other
pertinent conditions of the existing structure shall be conducted.

Section 20.2.2 - If drawings or other documents are used in the evaluation specified in Clause 20.2.1, their completeness (Starts on Page 160)
and any modifications of the structure not reflected on the drawings shall be considered in the
evaluation.

Section 20.2.3 - The analysis based on the investigation specified in Clause 20.2.1 shall satisfy the requirements of this (Starts on Page 160)
Standard.

Section 20.3 - Load tests (Starts on Page 160)
Notes:
1)
Although load tests should be conducted in a manner that will provide for safety of life and structure, safety
measures should not interfere with the load test procedures or affect results.

2)
Load testing prestressed systems with unbonded tendons where corrosion is suspected is generally not an
acceptable method for evaluating such tendons.

Section 20.3.1.1 - Before conducting a load test in accordance with this Clause, calculations shall be made to ensure that (Starts on Page 161)
the expected failure mode is ductile. If the expected failure mode is brittle, load testing using the
provisions of this Clause shall not be carried out.
Note: The provisions of Clause 20 are based on deflection recovery of systems or members with capacities that are
governed by ductile flexural failure. A load test in accordance with Clause 20 is inappropriate for assessing the
reliability of a member with a brittle failure mode.

Section 20.3.1.2 - If the strength evaluation is based on load tests, an engineer experienced in such evaluations shall (Starts on Page 161)
control the tests.

Section 20.3.1.3 - A load test shall generally not be conducted until the portion of the structure subjected to load is at (Starts on Page 161)
least 28 days old.
Note: When the owner of the structure, the contractor, and all other involved parties mutually agree, the test may
be conducted when the structure is less than 28 days old.

Section 20.3.1.4 - The structure or portion of the structure to be load tested shall be loaded in such a manner as to test (Starts on Page 161)
adequately the suspected weakness and to allow for the characteristics and pattern of the expected
loads.

Section 20.3.1.5 - A load to simulate the effect of the portion of the dead loads not already present shall be applied 24 h (Starts on Page 161)
before application of the test load and shall remain in place until all testing has been completed.

Section 20.3.1.6 - The superimposed test load shall be applied in not fewer than four approximately equal increments (Starts on Page 161)
without shock to the structure and in a manner that avoids arching of the load materials.

Section 20.3.1.7 - When an entire structural system in doubt is load tested or an entire questionable portion of a system is (Starts on Page 161)
load tested, the test load shall be 90% of the factored loads Mf, Vf, and Pf.

Section 20.3.1.8 - When only a portion of a structural system in doubt is tested and the results of the tests are taken as (Starts on Page 161)
representative of the structural adequacy of untested portions of the system, the test load shall be
equal to the factored loads Mf, Vf, and Pf.

Section 20.3.1.9 - The test load shall be left on the structure for 24 h. (Starts on Page 161)
reproduction interdite.

Section 20.3.1.10 - If the portion of the structure tested fails or shows visible indications of impending failure, it shall be (Starts on Page 162)
considered to have failed the test.

Section 20.3.2.1 - Note: The requirements of this Clause are in addition to the requirements specified in Clause 20.3.1.10. (Starts on Page 162)
When flexural systems or members, including beams and slabs, are load tested for moment resistance,
they shall have a deflection recovery, within 24 h of removal of the test load, as follows:
Non-prestressed members
First test
60%
Retest
75%
Prestressed members
80%

Section 20.3.2.3 - In the case of two-way slabs, the central slab deflection shall be measured relative to the deflection at (Starts on Page 162)
the supporting columns or walls.

Section 20.3.2.4 - Immediately before application of the test load, the necessary initial readings shall be made as a datum (Starts on Page 162)
for the measurements of deflections caused by the application of the test load.

Section 20.3.2.6 - Following the action specified in Clause 20.3.2.5, the test load shall be removed. Deflection readings (Starts on Page 162)
shall be taken 24 h after removal of the test load.

Section 20.3.2.7 - Retests of non-prestressed construction shall not be conducted until 72 h after removal of the first test (Starts on Page 162)

21 Special provisions for seismic design

Section 21.1 - Scope (Starts on Page 162)
Clauses 21.2 to 21.11 specify requirements for the design and construction of reinforced concrete
members of structures for which the design earthquake forces have been determined on the basis of
energy dissipation from the non-linear response of the seismic-force-resisting system (SFRS).
reproduction interdite.

Section 21.2.1 - Capacity design (Starts on Page 163)
The structures identified in Clause 21.1 shall be the subject of capacity design. In the capacity design of
structures, kinematically consistent mechanisms are chosen, and the energy-dissipating elements are
designed and detailed as specified in Clauses 21.2 to 21.8. All other structural elements in the SFRS are
then provided with sufficient reserve capacity to ensure that the chosen energy-dissipating mechanisms
are maintained in the selected locations throughout the deformations that can occur.

Section 21.2.2 - Seismic-force-resisting systems (Starts on Page 163)
Clauses 21.2 to 21.8 specify requirements covering the design and detailing of the standard seismic-
force-resisting systems (SFRSs) identified in the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC).
Clauses 21.2 to 21.8 were developed for the design of individual SFRSs that are continuous over the full
building height and do not have significant discontinuity in strength or stiffness.
When an SFRS has a strength, stiffness, or geometrical irregularity as defined by the NBCC, or when
combinations of SFRSs acting in the same direction are not continuous over the building height, or when
elements from two or more SFRS types are combined to create a hybrid system, the design of the SFRS
and gravity-load resisting frame shall account for the actual inelastic behaviour of the SFRS. An
evaluation shall be carried out to
a)
verify the compatibility of the system(s);
b)
confirm the assumed inelastic (energy-dissipating) mechanism(s);
c)
confirm that the inelastic demands are less than the inelastic capacities; and
d)
account for redistribution of forces.
The requirement for such an evaluation may be waived if the performance has been previously verified
by experimental evidence and analysis.
A reinforced concrete seismic-force-resisting system other than those specified in Clauses 21.2 to 21.8
may be used as an alternative solution if it can be demonstrated through testing, research, and analysis
that the seismic performance of the structural system is at least equivalent to that of a standard SFRS
that meets the requirements of Clauses 21.2 to 21.8.
Note: The requirements for determining Rd and Ro of the system are given in the National Building Code of Canada
and Commentary J, and the Compliance requirements for alternative solutions are given in Division A of NBCC.

Section 21.2.3 - Design based on nonlinear dynamic analysis (Starts on Page 163)
Nonlinear dynamic analysis used for the basis of design shall include a sufficient number of appropriate
ground motion time histories and shall include appropriate nonlinear material models for the structural
elements that consider the reversed cyclic loading characteristics such as strength and stiffness
degradation, ductility capacity and general hysteretic response. The nonlinear analysis and resulting
design shall be reviewed by a qualified independent review panel.
Note: The National Building Code of Canada and Commentary J provide the requirements for a special study using
nonlinear dynamic analysis. The 2011 LATBSDC (Los Angeles Tall Buildings Structural Design Council) Alternate
Procedure for Seismic Analysis and Design of Tall Buildings Located in the Los Angeles Area provides the
requirements for a qualified independent review panel.

not to be part of the SFRS might be required to satisfy Clause 21.11 depending on the value of
IEFaSa(0.2) and the calculated maximum interstorey drift as given in Clause 21.11.1.1.

Section 21.2.5.1 - The interaction of all structural and non-structural elements that materially affect the linear and non- (Starts on Page 164)
linear response of the structure to earthquake motions shall be considered in the analysis.

The design of squat walls with hw/ℓw of 2.0 or less shall be done in accordance with the strut-and-tie
method in Clause 11.4 or shall be done in accordance with the appropriate parts of Clause 21.5.10 as
follows:
a)
The shear design shall be in accordance with Clauses 21.5.10.8.3 to 21.5.10.8.7, except that the
maximum factored shear stress given in Clause 21.5.10.8.5 shall be increased to 0.20ϕcf′

b)
The design for overturning resistance of squat walls shall be in accordance with Clause 21.5.10.7.
The additional requirements in Clauses 21.6.3.4 to 21.6.3.7 shall not apply.

Section 21.6.3.4 - Design shear force (Starts on Page 193)
The factored shear force envelope determined in accordance with NBCC shall be increased by the ratio
of the factored bending resistance to factored bending moment both calculated at the base of the wall;
however, the factored shear force need not be taken larger than that resulting from design load
combinations including earthquake, with load effects calculated using RdRo equal to 1.3.

Section 21.6.3.5 - Shear resistance (Starts on Page 193)
The shear resistance of a flexural wall with hw/ℓw greater than 2.0 shall be determined using the

cbwdv, where the effective shear depth, dv, of a wall need not be taken less than 0.8ℓw.

Section 21.6.3.6 - Ductility requirements above potential hinge region (Starts on Page 193)
At every section above the potential plastic hinge region, the distance from the extreme compression
fibre to the neutral axis, c, determined by plane sections analysis for the factored axial load acting on
the wall and a bending moment causing the maximum compression strain εcu at the extreme
compression fibre, shall not exceed 0.6ℓw. If the distance from the extreme compression fibre to the
neutral axis, c, exceeds 0.3ℓw, concentrated vertical reinforcement consisting of a minimum of four bars
placed in at least two layers shall be provided at the ends of all walls. This reinforcement shall be at
least tied as a compression member in accordance with Clause 7.6.5 and the ties shall be detailed as
hoops.
Note: The intent is to ensure that if the shear wall was subjected to a sufficiently large bending moment, vertical
reinforcement at the tension end of the wall will yield before concrete will crush at the compression end of the
wall. The compression strain depth c depends primarily on the geometry of the cross section, the concrete strength
and the axial compression force applied to the wall.

Section 21.6.3.7.1 - Height of potential plastic hinge region (Starts on Page 194)
Shear walls designed with Rd = 1.5 are expected to experience yielding of vertical reinforcement when

not exceed 0.5ℓw.
Note: The intent is to ensure that the vertical reinforcement at the tension end of the wall will yield before

Section 21.7.1.1 - Application (Starts on Page 195)
Clause 21.7 provides seismic design requirements for reinforced concrete wall panels ranging from solid
wall panels to wall panels with large openings (frames). All tilt-up wall panels shall meet the
requirements of Clause 23.

Section 21.7.1.2 - Types of seismic-force-resisting systems (Starts on Page 195)
The NBCC specifies three types of seismic-force-resisting systems for concrete tilt-up construction.
Clauses 21.7.1 to 21.7.4 provide design requirements for concrete tilt-up walls and frames designed
with Rd ≥1.5. Clause 21.7.5 provides additional requirements for concrete tilt-up walls and frames
designed with Rd = 2.0.
Note: Limited Ductility (Rd = 1.5) walls and frames may be designed using a force-based approach, while
moderately ductile (Rd = 2.0) walls and frames are designed using a displacement-based approach that explicitly
accounts for the inelastic displacement demands on wall panels.

Section 21.7.1.3.1 - Ductile limit states (Starts on Page 195)
All tilt-up construction with Rd ≥1.5 shall be designed such that the governing ultimate limit state of the
tilt-up walls is ductile. Acceptable limit states include
a)
rocking of individual wall panels or wall panel groups;
b)
sliding along the base of the tilt-up wall; or
reproduction interdite.
c)
for panels with large openings (frames), yielding of the beams and columns.
Note: Rocking of individual wall panels or wall panel groups might require yielding of panel-to-panel shear
connectors and/or tie-down connectors. Sliding along the base of walls can be difficult to achieve unless walls have
a simple configuration, and post-earthquake damage due to sliding can be difficult to repair.

Section 21.7.1.3.2 - Non-ductile limit states (Starts on Page 196)
The following non-ductile ultimate limit states shall be prevented:
a)
failure of any connection between the wall panels and roof diaphragm; and
b)
shear failure of a wall panel or portion of a wall panel.

Section 21.7.1.4 - Building lateral period (Starts on Page 196)
When established methods of mechanics considering roof diaphragm flexibility are used to determine
the fundamental lateral period of a tilt-up building in accordance with the NBCC, the wall panels in the
building shall meet the requirements for moderately ductile (Rd = 2.0) walls and frames.
Note: When the influence of the flexible diaphragm is accounted for in the calculation of the building period, a
displacement-based approach is used to account for the increased inelastic displacement demands on wall panels
due to the flexible roof diaphragm.

Section 21.7.2.1.1 - Factored in-plane shear force (Starts on Page 196)
Wall panels shall be designed for the factored in-plane shear forces transferred to the panel by the
diaphragm and the additional in-plane shear force due to the panel self-weight. A rational analysis shall
be used to distribute the in-plane shear force to individual panels in one wall.
Note: A rational analysis needs to account for the deformation compatibility of the panels and structural members
used to transfer the in-plane shear such as drag struts and collector elements, as well as the deformation capacity
of all connectors.

Section 21.7.2.1.2 - Minimum shear resistance (Starts on Page 196)
Wall panels shall have a factored shear resistance greater than the shear force due to the effects of
factored loads determined in accordance with Clause 21.7.2.1.1, but not less than the smaller of
a)
the shear force corresponding to the development of the factored overturning moment capacity
for Rd = 1.5, or nominal overturning moment capacity for Rd = 2.0, of the individual wall panel or
wall panel group; or
b)
the shear force resulting from design load combinations that include earthquake effect, with loads
calculated using RdRo equal to 1.3.

Section 21.7.2.2 - Out-of-plane shear and bending moment (Starts on Page 196)

reproduction interdite.

Section 21.7.2.3 - Transfer of forces to foundation (Starts on Page 197)
A reliable load path shall be provided to transfer all in-plane and out-of-plane forces to the supporting
soil.
Note: A direct or indirect connection to the wall footing may be used to provide a reliable load path. Slab-sliding
resistance is difficult to predict and unreinforced or jointed floor slabs might not be reliable.

Section 21.7.2.4.1 - Out-of-plane forces (Starts on Page 197)
The connections to wall panels shall be designed for the factored out-of-plane forces calculated in
accordance with the requirements for the connection of elements to the structure in the NBCC
assuming a flexible element (wall panel) and non-ductile connections; but not less than the forces
specified in Clause 23.2.9.2.
Note: The Cement Association of Canada's Concrete Design Handbook summarizes the appropriate values of Cp,
Ar, and Rp to be used.

Section 21.7.2.4.2 - In-plane forces (Starts on Page 197)
Wall panel connections that transfer in-plane shear forces shall be designed for the factored forces
resulting from design load combinations that include earthquake effect, with loads calculated using Rd
Ro that depends on the type of connector as follows:
a)
Ductile wall connections shall be designed using the same RdRo as the seismic-force-resisting-
system.
b)
Non-ductile wall connections shall be designed using RdRo equal to 1.3.
c)
When a ductile structural member is used to transmit the in-plane shear force to a non-ductile
connection, the non-ductile connection need not be designed for a force greater than the probable
capacity of the ductile member.

Section 21.7.3.1 - Strength and ductility of connectors (Starts on Page 197)
All wall panel connectors shall be designed based on experimentally-established strengths and ductility
or shall be designed in accordance with established design procedures such as given in Annex D.

connectors that have experimentally established strengths and ductility.

Section 21.7.3.2 - Overturning capacity (Starts on Page 197)
The required factored overturning moment capacity of wall panels shall be provided using any
combination of the panel self weight, vertical load acting directly on the panel, panel-to-panel shear
connectors and tie-down anchors. Panel-to-panel shear connectors shall be ductile. For other
connections, if non-ductile connectors or anchors are used, the displacement compatibility of the
connectors shall be accounted for. The effective length of the wall panel shall account for concrete
spalling at the edge of the panel.
Note: When a panel rocks up on a corner, the concrete outside of tied vertical reinforcement will likely spall off
thereby reducing the effective length of the panel.

Section 21.7.3.3 - Sliding shear resistance at base of wall (Starts on Page 197)
The required factored sliding shear resistance shall be provided by a combination of shear friction and
shear connectors. All wall panels shall have shear connectors at the base and cannot rely only on shear

Wall panels with openings shall either be designed as solid panels with the forces transmitted around
the openings or shall be designed as a frame in accordance with Clauses 21.7.4.2 to 21.7.4.5.

When determining that the governing ultimate limit state of a tilt-up frame is ductile as required by
Clause 21.7.1.3, the influence of forces due to panel connections shall be accounted for.
Note: Panel-to-panel shear connections between panel legs (lower columns) can influence the load distribution or
failure mode of the panel legs.

In panels designed using Rd = 2.0, the stirrups shall be detailed as hoops.

Section 21.7.4.3.3 - Cover spalling (Starts on Page 199)
When calculating the factored moment resistance of a column or beam, the influence of cover spalling
on the compression face of the member shall be accounted for.

Section 21.7.4.4 - Minimum shear resistance of frame members (Starts on Page 199)
The factored shear resistance of beams and columns resisting earthquake effects shall be not less than
the lesser of
a)
the sum of the maximum shear force associated with development of the factored moment
resistances for Rd = 1.5, or nominal moment resistances for Rd = 2.0, of the member at each

Section 21.9.7.4 - Chords, collectors, struts, and ties may be structural steel and/or reinforced concrete sections. (Starts on Page 204)
Structural steel members used for this purpose shall have headed stud shear connectors designed to

21.9.5.3.

Section 21.9.8 - Construction joints (Starts on Page 204)
All construction joints in diaphragms shall comply with Clause 6.3. Contact surfaces shall be treated as
specified in Clause 11.5.

Section 21.10.1.1 - Foundations resisting earthquake-induced forces or transferring earthquake-induced forces between a (Starts on Page 204)
structure and the ground may be designed in accordance with Clause 21.10.2 if the foundation meets
the limitations given in Clause 21.10.2.1; otherwise, they shall be designed using the general method
specified in Clause 21.10.3.

Section 21.10.1.2 - The requirements of Clause 21.10 for piles, drilled piers, caissons, and slabs-on-grade shall be in (Starts on Page 204)
addition to the requirements specified in Clause 15.

Section 21.10.2.1 - General (Starts on Page 204)
Foundations, including foundation walls and footings, that are restrained from rotating by structural
elements may be designed in accordance with Clauses 21.10.2.2 to 21.10.2.3 if the structure restraining
foundation movement is shown to have sufficient stiffness and strength to prevent significant increase
in displacement of the SFRS; otherwise, the foundation shall be designed in accordance with Clause
21.10.3.
Note: Examples of foundations that are restrained against rotation include: foundations that are tied down by soil
anchors, foundations supported on piles and foundations supporting shear walls that are connected by multiple
diaphragms to foundation walls supported on separate foundations. Foundation movements, which may be
determined using the procedures in Clause 21.10.3.3.1, can influence the distribution of forces between the
foundation and the restraining structure.

Section 21.10.2.2 - Factored resistance (Starts on Page 205)
Foundations shall have a factored overturning resistance and a factored shear resistance, including
factored shear resistance of walls and factored sliding shear resistance of footings, not less than
required to resist the smaller of
a)
the factored gravity loads and the nominal overturning capacity of the SFRS and the corresponding
shear force; or
b)
the forces from design load combinations that include earthquake effects calculated using RdRo
equal to 1.3.

Section 21.10.2.3 - Design of foundation walls restrained by diaphragms (Starts on Page 205)
When an SFRS is designed using Rd ≥2.0, all foundation walls that provide the restraint to foundation
movement required by Clause 21.10.2.1 due to being interconnected by multiple diaphragms shall be
designed for the forces determined in accordance with Clause 21.5.2.2.9. In addition, all foundation
walls that are part of the SFRS shall be designed in accordance with Clause 21.5.2.2.4.
Note: When an SFRS is designed using Rd < 2.0, consideration should be given to the large shear forces that can
develop due to bending moment reversals in the wall from diaphragm forces.

Section 21.10.3.1 - General (Starts on Page 205)
Foundations, including foundation walls, shall be designed to meet the requirements of Clauses

Section 21.10.3.2.1 - General (Starts on Page 205)
All foundations shall satisfy both of the following requirements:
a)
The factored overturning resistance of foundations, including foundation walls and footings, shall
satisfy one of Clauses 21.10.3.2.2 to 21.10.3.2.4.
b)
The factored shear resistance of foundations, including factored shear resistance of walls and
factored sliding shear resistance of footings, shall not be less than that required to resist the
factored gravity loads and the shear force corresponding to the required factored overturning
resistance in Item a); but need not exceed the forces from design load combinations that include
earthquake effects calculated using RdRo equal to 1.3.

Section 21.10.3.2.2 - Maximum required overturning resistance (Starts on Page 205)
The overturning capacity of a foundation calculated using a bearing stress in the soil or rock equal to 1.5
times the factored bearing resistance and all other resistances equal to 1.3 times the factored
resistance need not exceed the overturning moment resulting from design load combinations that
include earthquake effects calculated using RdRo equal to 1.0. The factor of 1.3 shall not apply to the
portion of resistance to uplift or overturning resulting from gravity loads.
Note: Overstrength in the bearing resistance of soil or rock can result in a very small increase in overturning
capacity of the foundation. Thus, the minimum overstrength is applied to the resistance and the forces are
calculated using RdRo equal to 1.0 rather than 1.3.

Section 21.10.3.2.3 - Capacity-protected foundations (Starts on Page 206)
Except as given in Clauses 21.10.3.2.2 and 21.10.3.2.4, foundations shall have a factored overturning
resistance greater than or equal to what is required to resist the factored gravity loads and the
overturning capacity of the SFRS given below:
RdRo/γw ≤2.5
RdRo/γw > 2.5
Overturning capacity of SFRS:
Nominal
Probable
When the SFRS is not a concrete wall, the equivalent overstrength factor for the SFRS shall be
substituted for γw. In lieu of a more detailed analysis, γw may be taken equal to Ro.

Section 21.10.3.2.4 - Not capacity-protected (NCP) foundations (Starts on Page 206)
Foundations that are not restrained against rotation may be designed as NCP foundations if it can be
shown that the SFRS and the members not considered part of the SFRS can tolerate the increased
displacements. Foundations that are restrained by flexible structures may also be designed as NCP
foundations if it can be shown that the restraining structure can also tolerate the increased
displacements.
Note: Examples of foundations that cannot be designed as NCP foundations include foundations tied down by soil
anchors, foundations supported on piles, raft foundations, and foundations supporting walls that are restrained by
a stiff structure consisting of multiple diaphragms connected to large foundation walls. The procedures in Clause

Section 21.11 - can be used to demonstrate that the members not considered part of the SFRS and a flexible restraining (Starts on Page 206)
structure have adequate displacement capacity.
NCP foundations shall satisfy the requirements of Clauses 21.10.3.3.3 and 21.10.3.4, and shall have a
factored overturning resistance not less than what is required to resist the factored gravity loads and
the larger of
a)
75% of the nominal overturning capacity of the SFRS; or
b)
the overturning moment resulting from design load combinations that include earthquake effects
calculated using RdRo equal to 2.0.

Section 21.10.3.3.1 - General (Starts on Page 206)
The increased displacements due to movements of foundations shall be accounted for in the design of
the SFRS and in the design of the members not considered part of the SFRS.
Note: A description of how to estimate foundation movements are given in the explanatory notes of the Cement
Association of Canada’s Concrete Design Handbook.

Section 21.10.3.3.2 - Movements of capacity-protected foundations (Starts on Page 206)
When the factored overturning resistance of a foundation satisfies Clause 21.10.3.2.1 or 21.10.3.2.2, the
foundation movements may be calculated using a static analysis. The footing rotation is calculated as
the difference in vertical displacements at the “toe” and “heel” of the footing, divided by the length of
footing, ℓf. The analysis shall account for the assumed bearing stress distribution in the soil or rock to
resist the applied loads and the corresponding stiffness of the soil or rock.
In lieu of a more detailed analysis, the interstorey drift ratio of the building determined from a fixed-
base model shall be increased at every level, including immediately above the footing, by an interstorey
drift ratio equal to the footing rotation, in radians.
reproduction interdite.
📐 In lieu of a more detailed analysis, the footing rotation may be estimated from Equation 21.22 when the
applied overturning moment is sufficiently large to cause the “heel” of the footing to up-lift, which
occurs when Mf > Pf ℓf/6.
📐 Equation 21.22
where
θI
=I footing rotation in radians

soil or rock immediately below the foundation, is in units of m/s
ℓfI
=I length of footing (perpendicular to axis of rotation)
When the overturning moment is less than the moment required to cause up-lift, the footing rotation
📐 may be assumed to vary linearly from zero at Mf = 0 up to the rotation given by Equation 21.22 when
Mf = Pf ℓf/6.

Section 21.10.3.3.3 - Movements of not capacity-protected (NCP) foundations (Starts on Page 207)
Except as given below, the rotations of NCP foundations designed in accordance with Clause 21.10.3.2.4
shall be determined using a dynamic analysis that accounts for the reduced rotational stiffness of the
footing due to footing uplift and soil deformation.
In lieu of using dynamic analysis to determine the increased drifts due to rotations of NCP foundations,
the interstorey drift ratio of the building determined from a fixed-base model shall be increased at
every level, including immediately above the footing, by a value equal to the largest of
a)
50% of the displacement at the top of the SFRS determined from a fixed-base model, divided by
the height above the footing;
b)
📐 the rotation of the foundation calculated using Equation 21.22 when subjected to an overturning
moment equal to the nominal overturning capacity of the SFRS; but need not exceed 3.0 times the
rotation of the foundation when subjected to an overturning moment equal to the factored
overturning resistance of the foundation; or
c)
an interstorey drift ratio equal to 0.005.
Note: The drift ratio increases are upper-bound values that can be used to avoid calculating the actual increased
drift ratios in those cases where the SFRS and the members not considered part of the SFRS can easily tolerate the
increases. When an NCP foundation is subjected to an overturning moment greater than its factored overturning
resistance for Item b), the magnitude of uniform bearing stress in soil or rock required to resist the applied loads
📐 will exceed the factored bearing resistance when calculating rotations using Equation 21.22.

Section 21.10.3.4 - Design of footings in NCP foundations (Starts on Page 207)
When NCP foundations are designed in accordance with Clause 21.10.3.2.4, the factored flexural and
shear resistances of the footing shall be sufficient to develop the smallest of
a)
the forces determined using a bearing stress in the soil or rock equal to 2.5 times the factored
bearing resistance;

b)
the forces resulting from an applied moment on the foundation equal to the nominal overturning
resistance of the SFRS; or
c)
the forces from design load combinations that include earthquake effects calculated using RdRo
equal to 1.3.
Note: The plan dimensions of the footing, which control the foundation overturning resistance, are determined
using the factored bearing resistance of the soil or rock. The required amount of flexural reinforcement in the
footing and the shear design of the footing, which may be influenced by the shear span-to-depth ratio, must
account for possible overstrength in the bearing resistance of soil or rock. The increase in bearing stress in soil or
rock results in the same bearing stress resultant; but the vertical force is located closer to the toe of the
foundation.

Section 21.10.4.1 - Longitudinal reinforcement of columns and structural walls resisting forces induced by earthquake (Starts on Page 208)
effects shall extend into the footing, mat, or pile cap and shall be fully developed for tension at the
interface. In addition, the reinforcement shall satisfy the requirements of Clauses 21.10.4.2 to 21.10.4.4

Section 21.10.4.2 - Columns designed assuming fixed-end conditions at the foundation shall comply with Clause 21.10.2.1 (Starts on Page 208)

bottom of the foundation, with the free end of the bars oriented toward the centre of the column.

Section 21.10.4.3 - Concentrated wall reinforcement shall extend to the bottom of the footing, mat, or pile cap and (Starts on Page 208)
terminate with a 90° hook or mechanical anchorage.

Section 21.10.4.4 - Columns or areas of concentrated wall reinforcement that have an edge within one-half of the footing (Starts on Page 208)
depth from an edge of the footing shall have the same transverse reinforcement provided below the
top of the footing as provided above the footing. This transverse reinforcement shall extend into the
footing a distance not less than the smaller of the depth of the footing, mat, or pile cap or the
development length in tension of the longitudinal reinforcement.

Section 21.10.4.5 - Footings or pile caps that are a part of the foundation system resisting tension due to uplift forces shall (Starts on Page 208)

Section 21.10.5.1 - Grade beams and slabs designed to act as horizontal ties between pile caps or footings shall have (Starts on Page 208)
continuous longitudinal reinforcement that shall be developed within or beyond the supporting column
or anchored within the pile cap or footing at all discontinuities.

Section 21.10.5.2 - Grade beams not connected to a slab designed to act as horizontal ties between pile caps or footings (Starts on Page 209)
shall be proportioned in such a manner that the smallest cross-sectional dimension shall be equal to or
greater than the clear spacing between connected columns divided by 20, but need not be greater than
450 mm. Closed ties shall be provided at a spacing not exceeding one-half of the smallest cross-
sectional dimension or 300 mm, whichever is smaller.

Section 21.10.5.3 - Grade beams and beams that are part of a mat foundation subject to flexure from columns that are part (Starts on Page 209)
of the SFRS shall comply with Clause 21.3. Joints between these columns and grade beams shall comply
with Clause 21.3.3.

Section 21.10.5.4 - Slabs on grade that resist seismic forces from walls or columns that are part of the SFRS shall be (Starts on Page 209)
designed as structural diaphragms in accordance with Clause 21.9. The design drawings shall clearly
state that the slab on grade is a structural diaphragm and part of the SFRS.

Section 21.10.6.1 - The requirements of Clauses 21.10.6.2 to 21.10.6.6 shall apply to concrete piles supporting structures (Starts on Page 209)
designed for earthquake resistance.

Section 21.10.6.2 - Piles resisting tension loads shall have continuous longitudinal reinforcement over the length resisting (Starts on Page 209)
design tension forces. The longitudinal reinforcement shall be detailed to transfer tension forces within
the pile cap to supported structural members.

Section 21.10.6.3 - At sites where IEFaSa(0.2) is greater than 0.75 and the factored moment in piles, drilled piers, or caissons (Starts on Page 209)
is greater than 75% of the factored moment resistance, these members shall have confinement
reinforcement at the following locations:
a)
at the top of these members for at least five times the largest member’s cross-sectional dimension,
but not less than 2000 mm below the bottom of the pile cap;

Section 21.10.6.6 - Pile caps incorporating batter piles shall be designed to resist the full compressive strength of the batter (Starts on Page 210)
piles acting as short columns.
Note: Batter pile systems should be used with extreme caution because subsoil deformations caused by earthquake
effects can cause pile loads far in excess of those due to the seismic forces in the superstructure.

Section 21.11 - Members not considered part of the seismic-force-resisting system (Rd = 1.5, (Starts on Page 210)
2.0, 2.5, 3.5, or 4.0)
Note: One of the most common causes of building collapse during an earthquake is failure of one or more
components of the gravity-load resisting frame. The intent of this clause is to ensure an adequate level of strength
and/or ductility for all structural members not considered part of the seismic-force-resisting system (SFRS) but
subjected to seismically induced deformations. This is accomplished by ensuring elements either remain elastic or
yield in bending and contain appropriate detailing to ensure adequate shear resistances and flexural ductility.

Section 21.11.1.1 - Application (Starts on Page 210)
Independent of the Rd used to design the SFRS, the requirements of Clause 21.11 shall apply to all
members of the structure not considered part of the SFRS unless the building is located where
IEFaSa(0.2) is less than or equal to 0.35 or the maximum interstorey drift ratio at any level is less than
0.005.
The interstorey drift ratio shall be determined from an analysis in accordance with the National Building
Code of Canada, incorporating the effects of torsion, including accidental torsion, and accounting for
foundation movements in accordance with Clauses 21.10.3.3.

Section 21.11.1.2 - Elements not required to resist either gravity or lateral loading shall be considered non-structural (Starts on Page 210)
elements. These elements need not be detailed to the requirements of Clauses 21.11.2 to 21.11.4
provided that
a)
the effects of non-structural elements are accounted for in the design of structural elements if the
non-structural elements increase the seismically induced deformation of or the forces applied to a
structural element; and
b)
the non-structural elements are attached to the building in accordance with the NBCC.

Section 21.11.1.3 - Structural members not considered part of the seismic-force-resisting system (SFRS) shall meet the (Starts on Page 210)
requirements of Clauses 21.11.2 to 21.11.4.

Section 21.11.2.1 - General analysis requirements (Starts on Page 210)
An analysis shall be done to determine the forces and deformations induced in structural members not
considered to be part of the SFRS due to seismic demands on the SFRS. Such an analysis shall satisfy the
following:
a)
the complete structure shall be displaced laterally to the design displacements ΔfRdRo, determined
from an analysis in accordance with the NBCC, incorporating the effects of torsion; including
accidental torsion, and accounting for foundation movements in accordance with Clauses
21.10.3.3;
reproduction interdite.
b)
the inelastic displacement profile of the SFRS shall be accounted for;
Note: Yielding of the SFRS causes concentration of deformations at plastic hinge locations. In lieu of using a
nonlinear model of the SFRS, a linear model with appropriately reduced section properties at plastic hinge
locations may be used to estimate the inelastic displacement profile.
c)
cracking of concrete may be accounted for in determining the section properties used for structural
members not considered part of the SFRS; however, an upper-bound estimate of effective stiffness
shall be used in order to determine a safe estimate of the induced forces.
Note: Low estimates of average section properties such as those given in Clause 21.2.5.2 are used for the
SFRS to make a safe estimate of the design displacements of the overall building. Higher estimates of section
properties must be used for each structural member not considered part of the SFRS to make a safe estimate
of the forces induced in these members by the design displacements of the SFRS.
d)
The increased displacements due to foundation movement determined in accordance with Clauses

Section 21.11.2.2 - Simplified analysis of shear wall buildings (Starts on Page 211)
When the SFRS consists of shear walls or coupled walls, the requirements of Clauses 21.11.2.1 a), b),
and d) may be satisfied by the following simplified analysis:
a)
The shear force and bending moments induced in members of a gravity-load resisting frame shall
be determined at each level by subjecting the frame to the interstorey drift ratio given in Figure

Section 21.1 - for that level. The deflection Δ used to calculate the global drift ratio Δ/hw in Figure 21.1 shall (Starts on Page 211)
be the design lateral deflection at the top of the gravity-load resisting frame determined from an
analysis in accordance with the NBCC, incorporating the effects of torsion, including accidental
torsional moments, and accounting for foundation movements in accordance with
Clause 21.10.3.3. The height of the building hw shall be measured from the base of the plastic hinge
zone in the SFRS. All gravity-load resisting frames shall be investigated in each direction of loading.
Note: A gravity-load resisting frame may consist of a single column or wall and the attached beams or slabs
or may consist of a combination of columns, walls, beams, and slabs.

b)
The additional vertical load that is induced in vertical-load resisting members due to lateral
deformation of the structure shall be determined by summing the shear forces from all horizontal
members supported by the vertical-load resisting member using the procedure in Clause 21.11.2.2
a) for each level and summing the contribution for all levels above the level of interest.
c)
Over the height of the plastic hinge region of the SFRS, the minimum curvature demand on all
columns and walls shall not be taken less than the curvature demand associated with the inelastic
rotational demands on the SRFS given in Clauses 21.5.7.2 and 21.5.8.4.2.

Section 21.11.3.1 - Shear resistance (Starts on Page 212)
The factored shear resistance of each structural member not considered part of the SFRS shall be
sufficient to carry all shear forces due to factored gravity loads in addition to the shear forces induced
in the member when the structure is subjected to the seismic demands given in Clause 21.11.2. The
factored shear resistance need not exceed the maximum shear force that can develop due to the
probable bending moment resistance of the member or adjacent members as given in Clauses

Section 21.11.3.2 - Resistance of members transferring gravity loads (Starts on Page 212)
The factored resistance of all members not considered part of the SFRS that transfer gravity loads from
upper floors, including columns, walls, transfer girders and transfer slabs shall have sufficient capacity to
resist all vertical forces due to factored gravity loads in addition to the vertical forces induced in the
member when the structure is subjected to the seismic deformation demands given in Clause 21.11.2.
The additional vertical force due to seismic deformations need not exceed the maximum axial force that
can develop due to the nominal flexural resistance of the attached horizontal members.

Section 21.11.3.3.1 - Limitations on thin bearing walls (Starts on Page 212)
If the interstorey drift ratio determined from an analysis in accordance with the NBCC and incorporating
the effects of torsion, including accidental torsional moments, exceeds 0.005 at any point in the
structure, all bearing walls in the entire structure that are assumed to support gravity loads shall
contain two layers of uniformly distributed reinforcement and the two layers shall have a minimum
clear spacing of 50 mm.
Note: The maximum interstorey drift at any point in the structure is used as an indicator of seismic demands and
the flexibility of the structure. Walls with a single layer of reinforcement might not be able to tolerate cycles of
combined in-plane and out-of-plane displacement.

Section 21.11.3.3.2 - Plastic hinge regions of shear wall buildings (Starts on Page 212)
When the SFRS consists of shear walls or coupled walls, all columns and walls that support gravity loads
shall meet the following requirements over the storeys that the SFRS is required to be detailed for
plastic hinging to occur as specified in Clause 21.5.2.1:
a)
All columns and walls shall have a curvature capacity greater than the curvature demand given in
Clause 21.11.2.2 c). This requirement may be met by limiting the distance to the neutral axis, c, in
these members determined from a plane sections analysis for the factored resistance or from
Clause 21.5.7.4 to:

Clause 21.5.8.4.2
εcu shall be taken as 0.0035 unless the compression region of the member is confined as a column.
When εcu is taken greater than 0.0035 but less than 0.010, the amount of confinement
reinforcement shall be determined with kp taken as (0.1 + 30εcu). This reinforcement shall be
provided over a distance of not less than c from the compression face of the member.
For shear walls designed with Rd ≤2.5, in lieu of determining the limiting distance c in columns and
📐 walls from Equation 21.23, the simplified procedure given in Clause 21.5.7.6 may be used.
b)
Unless the design displacement ΔfRoRd is less than hw/200: all columns shall contain at least
buckling prevention ties in accordance with Clause 21.2.8.1 over the full height that the SFRS is
required to be detailed for plastic hinging to occur, and; all walls shall have concentrated vertical
reinforcement consisting of a minimum of four bars at each end of the wall and at the ends and
intersections of all wall flanges. The concentrated reinforcement in walls shall be at least tied as a
compression member in accordance with Clause 7.6.5, and the ties shall be detailed as hoops.

Section 21.11.3.3.3 - Design of columns and walls for plastic hinging (Starts on Page 213)
The seismic design requirements for columns and walls that are part of the gravity-load resisting frame
depend on the inelastic flexural deformation demands on the member. When seismic demands on the
gravity-load resisting frame are determined using a linear model, the design requirements shall be
determined from how much the calculated induced bending moment due to the seismic deformation
demands given in Clause 21.11.2 exceeds the factored bending resistance of the member.
Note: Factored resistances are used to account for the uncertainty in displacement demands – the resistances are
reduced rather than the displacement demands increased. Multiples of factored resistance are used as indicators
of inelastic displacement demands.
The calculated induced bending moment determined from a linear analysis shall be limited depending
on the type of member, axis of bending in walls, and level of applied axial compression as follows:

Section 21.11.3.4.1 - General (Starts on Page 214)
The design requirements for beams that are part of the gravity-load resisting frame depend on the
inelastic flexural deformation demands on the member. When seismic demands on the gravity-load
resisting frame are determined using a linear model, the design requirements shall be determined from
how much the induced bending moment due to the seismic deformation demands given in Clause

Section 21.11.2 - exceeds the factored bending resistance of the flexural member as follows: (Starts on Page 214)
Note: Factored resistances are used to account for the uncertainty in displacement demands – the resistances are

Black (1973) states “Construction conditions might require straightening of bars embedded in concrete. Field
bending should not be done without authorization of the engineer. The engineer must determine if the bars
should be bent cold or if heating should be employed. Bends should be gradual and must be straightened as
required.
“Tests have shown that Grade 400 reinforcing bars can be cold bent and straightened up to 90° at or near the
minimum bend diameter. If cracking or breaking occurs, heating to a maximum temperature of 820 °C should
be beneficial for avoiding overstressing and damage for subsequent bars. Bars that fracture during bending or
straightening must be spliced outside the bend region.
“Heating must be done in a manner that will avoid damage to the concrete. If the bend area is within
approximately 150 mm of the concrete, some protective insulation might be required. Heating of the bar

should be controlled by temperature-indicating crayons or other suitable means. The heated bars should not
be artificially cooled until they have naturally cooled to at least 300 °C”.

Section 6.6.2.5.3 - The bending tolerances shall be sufficiently accurate to comply with the placing and protection (Starts on Page 231)
tolerances specified in Clause 6.6.8.

Section 6.6.3.5 - Anchorage of spiral reinforcement shall be provided by 1-1/2 extra turns of spiral rod or wire at each (Starts on Page 231)
end of the spiral unit.

Section 6.6.3.6 - Splices in spirals shall have a minimum 50 bar diameter lap plus a 90° hook around a longitudinal bar at (Starts on Page 231)
the free end or shall be welded in accordance with CSA W186.

Section 6.6.3.7 - The reinforcing spiral shall extend from the floor level in any storey or from the top of the footing to the (Starts on Page 231)
level of the lowest horizontal reinforcement in the slab, drop panel, or beam above.

Section 6.6.3.8 - Where beams or brackets are not present on all sides of a column, ties shall extend above the (Starts on Page 231)
termination of the spiral to the bottom of the slab or drop panel.

Section 6.6.3.9 - In a column with a capital, the spiral shall extend to a plane at which the diameter or width of the (Starts on Page 231)
capital is twice that of the column.

Section 6.6.4.1 - The size, spacing, and arrangement of ties shall be as shown on the construction drawings. When (Starts on Page 231)
welded wire mesh of random length is used as tie reinforcement, the required splice length shall be
indicated on the drawings.

Section 6.6.5.2 - The clear distance between parallel bars or parallel bundles of bars shall be not less than 1.4 times the (Starts on Page 232)
bar diameter, not less than 1.4 times the nominal maximum size of the coarse aggregate, and not less
than 30 mm. This clear distance shall apply to the distance between a contact lap splice and adjacent
splices or bars.

Section 6.6.5.3 - Where parallel reinforcement is placed in two or more layers, the bars in the upper layer shall be placed (Starts on Page 232)
directly above those in the bottom layer.
Note: The intention of this Clause is to provide adequate spacing for concrete to be placed in the presence of
closely spaced mats of steel.

Section 6.6.6.1 - General (Starts on Page 232)
Concrete cover shall be measured from the concrete surface to the nearest deformation (or surface, for
smooth bars or wires) of the reinforcement. Reinforcement includes ties, stirrups, and main
reinforcement. For textured architectural surfaces, concrete cover shall be measured from the deepest
point of the textured surface.

Section 6.6.6.2.1 - The specified cover for reinforcement shall be based on consideration of life expectancy, exposure (Starts on Page 232)
conditions, protective systems, maintenance, and the consequences of corrosion.
Notes:
1)
The desired service life should be established early in the design process (see CSA S478).
2)
Requirements for corrosion protection can be influenced by the ease of access for inspection and repair and
the feasibility and cost of repair or replacement.
3)
Service life can be improved by
a)
increasing the cover and the duration of moist curing;
b)
reducing the water-to-cementing materials ratio;
c)
adding supplementary cementing materials, corrosion inhibitors, or membranes; and
d)
improving drainage.
4)
As the positioning of reinforcement is not exact, in some cases it is advisable to increase the specified cover to
ensure adequate protection. Service life can be extended by reducing the variability in placement of
reinforcement.

Section 6.6.6.2.2 - The specified cover for fibre-reinforced polymer bars, grids, and tendons in prestressed and reinforced (Starts on Page 232)
concrete shall be in accordance with CAN/CSA-S806.

Unless otherwise specified by the owner, reinforcement, prestressing steel, and post-tensioning ducts
shall be placed within the following tolerances:
a)
concrete cover: ±12 mm (however, the concrete cover shall in no case be reduced by more than 1/
3 of the specified cover);
b)

larger than 200 mm but less than 600 mm: ±12 mm; and
iii)
600 mm or larger: ±20 mm;
c)
lateral spacing of bars: ±30 mm;
d)
longitudinal location of bends and ends of bars: ±50 mm; and
e)
longitudinal location of bends and ends of bars at discontinuous ends of members: ±20 mm.
Note: Where reinforcement is added to provide a more rigid reinforcement mat or cage, i.e. in prefabricated
reinforcing cage, such additional reinforcement is not subject to the tolerances of this clause except for the
minimum cover requirements.

Section 6.6.10.1 - Welding of reinforcement shall conform to the requirements of CSA W186. Weldable grade bars shall (Starts on Page 233)
be used unless a fusion weld is employed.

Section 6.7.1 - General (Starts on Page 233)
Clause 6.7 covers the fabrication and placement of hardware for concrete building structures that have
been designed in accordance with CSA A23.3. The details and location of this hardware shall be shown
on the construction drawings.
Note: For reinforced concrete structures other than buildings, the owner should show clearly on the drawings and

member;
b)
8 mm centre-to-centre of adjacent anchor bolt groups;
c)
a maximum accumulation of 8 mm per 30 m along the established column line of multiple anchor
bolt groups, but not to exceed a total of 30 mm. The established column line is the actual field line
most representative of the centres of the as-built anchor bolt groups along a line of columns; and
d)
8 mm from the centre of any anchor bolt group to the established column line through that group.
The tolerances of Items (b), (c), and (d) apply to offset dimensions, as shown on the construction
drawings and measured perpendicular to the nearest column line.

B.3 Design method
B.3.1
The minimum slab thickness should be determined in accordance with Clause 13.2, but should not be
less than
a)
100 mm;
b)
the perimeter of the slab divided by 140, in the case of slabs discontinuous on one or more edges;
or
c)
the perimeter of the slab divided by 160, in the case of fully continuous slabs.
B.3.2
A two-way slab should be considered as consisting of strips in each direction, as follows:
a)
a middle strip, one-half of a panel in width, symmetrical about the panel centreline and extending
through the panel in the direction in which moments are considered; and
b)
a column strip, one-half of a panel in width, occupying the two quarter-panel areas outside the
middle strip.
B.3.3
Critical sections for moment should be assumed to be as follows:
a)
for negative moment, along the edges of the panel at the faces of the supports; and
b)
for positive moment, along the centrelines of the panels.
B.3.4
Negative bending moments per unit width for the middle strips should be computed in accordance with
the following equations and the coefficients specified in Table B.1:
a)
Equation B.1
b)
Equation B.2
B.3.5
Positive bending moments per unit width should be computed as the sum of Equations B.3 and B.4 for
the middle strip in the short direction and Equations B.5 and B.6 for the middle strip in the long
direction, using the coefficients specified in Table B.2. These equations are as follows:
a)
Equation B.3
b)
Equation B.4
c)
Equation B.5
d)
Equation B.6
reproduction interdite.
B.3.6
The bending moments in the column strips should be two-thirds of the bending moments in the middle
strip.
B.3.7
Where the ratio, m, of short to long span is less than 0.5, the slab should be considered a one-way slab
in the short direction, but reinforcement for negative moments required for m equal to 0.5 should be
provided in the long direction.
B.3.8
At discontinuous edges of two-way slabs, a negative moment of three-quarters of the positive moment
should be assumed.
B.3.9
In all cases, special reinforcement should be provided at exterior corners in accordance with
Clause 13.12.5.
B.3.10
Where the negative moment on one side of a support is less than 80% of that on the other side, the
difference should be distributed between the two slabs in proportion to their relative stiffnesses.
B.3.11
The shear stresses in the slabs should be computed on the assumption that the load, wf, is distributed
to the supports in accordance with Clause B.4.
B.4 Loads on slab supports
B.4.1
The loads on the supporting beams of a two-way rectangular panel may be assumed to be the load
within the tributary areas of the panel bounded by the intersection of 45° lines from the corners and
the median line of the panel parallel to the long side.
B.4.2
The bending moments in the supporting beams may be determined for design purposes by using an
equivalent uniform load per unit length of beam for each panel supported, as follows:
a)
for the short span:
Equation B.7
a)
for the long span:
Equation B.8

Notes:
1)
This Annex is not a mandatory part of this Standard.
2)
This Annex provides an adapted version of portions of Subsection 4.1.3 from an unpublished draft of the
National Building Code of Canada, 2015 (NBCC). Those portions deal with load factors and load combinations.
This material has been adapted in accordance with CSA editorial requirements and is included for information
only.
3)
The load factors and load combinations presented in this Annex are discussed in Part 4 of the NBCC User’s
Guide and should be used in conjunction with the resistance factors specified in Clause 8.4.
4)
The NBCC defines the following classes of loads:
a)
permanent loads such as dead loads, D, and effects of prestress, P;
b)
variable loads due to use and occupancy, L, wind loads, W, and snow loads, S;
c)
rare loads such as earthquake loads, E; and
d)
imposed deformations, T (see Clause 8.2.2).
5)
The equations used to compute the loads S, W, and E for snow, wind, and earthquake in the NBCC include
importance factors Is, Iw, and IE, which are a function of the use and occupancy of the building.

C.1.1 Definitions
The following definitions apply in this Annex:
Companion load — a specified variable load that accompanies the principal load in a given load
combination.
Companion-load factor — a factor that, when applied to a companion load in the load combination,
gives the probable magnitude of a companion load acting simultaneously with the factored principal
load.
Effects — forces, moments, deformations, or vibrations that occur in the structure.
Factored load — the product of a specified load and its principal-load factor or companion-load factor.
Factored resistance — the product of nominal resistance, R, and the applicable resistance factor, ϕ.
Importance factor — a factor applied in Subsections 4.1.6 to 4.1.8 of the NBCC to obtain the specified
load, to account for the consequences of failure as related to the limit state and the use and occupancy
of the building.
Limit states — those conditions of a building structure in which the building ceases to fulfill the function
for which it was designed.
Note: Those states concerning safety are called ultimate limit states (ULS) and include exceeding the load-carrying
capacity, overturning, sliding, and fracture. Those states that restrict the intended use and occupancy of the
building are called serviceability limit states (SLS) and include deflection, vibration, permanent deformation, and
local structural damage such as cracking. Those limit states that represent failure under repeated loading are
called fatigue limit states.
Principal load — the specified variable load or rare load that dominates in a given load combination.
Principal-load factor — a factor applied to the principal load in the load combination to account for the
variability of the load and load pattern and analysis of its effects.
Specified loads (D, E, H, L, P, S, T, and W) — the loads specified in Note (6) of the preliminary Notes to
this Annex.
C.1.2 Strength and stability
C.1.2.1

C.1.2.2
Except as provided in Clause C.1.2.3, the effect of factored loads for a building or structural component

C.1.2.3
Other load combinations that must also be considered are the principal loads acting with the
companion loads taken as zero.

Annex D (informative)
Anchorage
Note: This informative (non-mandatory) Annex has been written in normative (mandatory) language to facilitate
adoption where users of the Standard or regulatory authorities wish to adopt it formally as additional
requirements to this Standard.
D.1 Introduction
D.1.1
This Annex specifies design requirements for anchors in concrete used to transmit forces to concrete
elements by tension, shear, or a combination of tension and shear between
a)
connected structural elements; or
b)
safety-related attachments and structural elements.
The specified safety levels are intended for in-service conditions rather than for short-term handling and
construction conditions.
D.1.2
This Annex applies to cast-in anchors and to post-installed expansion (torque-controlled and
displacement-controlled), undercut and adhesive anchors (see Figure D.1). Adhesive anchors shall be
installed in concrete having a minimum age of 21 days at time of anchor installation. Specialty inserts,
through-bolts, multiple anchors connected to a single steel plate at the embedded end of the anchors,
grouted anchors, and direct anchors such as powder or pneumatic-actuated nails or bolts are not
included in the provisions of Annex D. Reinforcement used as part of the embedment shall be designed
in accordance with the applicable clauses of this Standard.
D.1.3
Design provisions are included for the following types of anchors:
a)
Headed studs and headed bolts having a geometry that has been demonstrated to result in a
pullout strength in uncracked concrete equal to or exceeding 1.4 Npr, where Npr is given in Equation
D.16;
b)
Hooked bolts having a geometry that has been demonstrated to result in a pullout strength
without the benefit of friction in uncracked concrete equal to or exceeding 1.4 Npr, where Npr is
given in Equation D.17;
c)
Post-installed expansion and undercut anchors that meet the assessment criteria of ACI 355.2/
355.2R; and
d)
Adhesive anchors that meet the assessment criteria of ACI 355.4M.
D.1.4
Load applications that are predominantly high cycle fatigue or impact are not covered by this Annex.
D.2 Definitions
The following definitions apply in this Annex:
5% fractile — a statistical term meaning 90% confidence that there is a 95% probability of the actual
strength exceeding the nominal strength.
reproduction interdite.
Adhesive — chemical components formulated from organic polymers, or a combination of organic
polymers and inorganic materials that cure when blended together.
Adhesive anchor — a post-installed anchor, inserted into hardened concrete with an anchor hole
diameter not greater than 1.5 times the anchor diameter, that transfers loads to the concrete by bond
between the anchor and the adhesive, and bond between the adhesive and the concrete.
Anchor — a steel element either cast into concrete or post-installed into a hardened concrete member
and used to transmit applied loads to the concrete. Cast-in anchors include headed bolts, hooked bolts
(J- or L-bolts) and headed studs. Post-installed anchors include expansion anchors, undercut anchors,
and adhesive anchors. Steel elements for adhesive anchors include threaded rods, deformed reinforcing
bars, or internally threaded steel sleeves with external deformations.
Anchor group — a number of similar anchors having approximately equal effective embedment depths
with spacing s between adjacent anchors such that the projected areas overlap. See Clause D.4.1.2..
Anchor pullout strength — the strength corresponding to the anchoring device or a major component
of the device sliding out from the concrete without breaking out a substantial portion of the
surrounding concrete (see Figure D.4A).
Anchor reinforcement — reinforcement used to transfer the full design load from the anchors into the
structural member. See Clauses D.6.2.9 and D.7.2.9 and Figures D.10, D.17A, and D.17B.
Attachment — the structural assembly, external to the surface of the concrete, that transmits loads to
or receives loads from the anchor.
Brittle steel element — an element with a tensile test elongation of less than 14% or reduction in area
less than 30%, or both.
Cast-in anchor — a headed bolt, headed stud, or hooked bolt installed before concrete is placed.
Concrete breakout strength — the strength corresponding to a volume of concrete surrounding the
anchor or group of anchors separating from the member (see Figures D.4A, D.4B and D.5).
Concrete pryout strength — the strength corresponding to formation of a concrete spall behind a short,
stiff anchor, displaced in the direction opposite to the applied shear force (see Figure D.4B).
Distance sleeve — a sleeve that encases the centre part of an undercut anchor, a torque-controlled
expansion anchor, or a displacement-controlled expansion anchor but does not expand.
Ductile steel element — an element with a tensile test elongation of at least 14% and a reduction in
area of at least 30%. A steel element meeting the requirements of CSA G40.21 or ASTM A307 shall be
considered as a ductile steel element. Deformed reinforcing bars meeting the requirements of CSA
G30.18, shall be considered as ductile steel elements.
Edge distance — the distance from the edge of the concrete surface to the centre of the nearest
anchor.
Effective embedment depth — the overall depth through which the anchor transfers force to or from
the surrounding concrete. The effective embedment depth will normally be the depth of the concrete
failure surface in tension applications. For cast-in headed anchor bolts and headed studs, the effective
embedment depth is measured from the bearing contact surface of the head (see Figure D.1).
reproduction interdite.
Expansion anchor — a post-installed anchor inserted into hardened concrete that transfers loads to and
from the concrete by direct bearing, friction, or both. Expansion anchors may be torque controlled
(where the expansion is achieved by a torque acting on the screw or bolt) or displacement controlled
(where the expansion is achieved by impact forces acting on a sleeve or plug and the expansion is
controlled by the length of travel of the sleeve or plug).
Expansion sleeve — the outer part of an expansion anchor that is forced outward by the centre part
either by applied torque or impact, to bear against the sides of the predrilled hole.
Headed stud — a headed steel anchor that meets the requirements of CSA W59 or AWS D1.1/AWS
D1.1 and is affixed to a plate or similar steel attachment by stud arc welding before casting. The
underside of the plate or steel attachment is assumed to be cast flush with the concrete surface.
Hooked bolt — a cast-in anchor anchored mainly by bearing of the 90° bend (L-bolt) or 180° bend (J-
bolt) against the concrete at its embedded end and having a minimum eh of 3da.
Horizontal or upwardly inclined anchor — an anchor installed in a hole drilled horizontally or in a hole
drilled at any orientation above horizontal. See Figure D.2.
Manufacturer’s Printed Installation Instructions (MPII) — published instructions for the correct
installation of the anchor under all covered installation conditions as supplied in the product packaging.
Post-installed anchor — an anchor installed in hardened concrete. Expansion, undercut and adhesive
anchors are examples of post-installed anchors.
Projected area — the area on the free surface of the concrete member that is used to represent the
larger base of the assumed rectilinear failure surface. See Clauses D.6.2.1 and D.7.2.1.
Projected influence area — the rectilinear area on the free surface of the concrete member that is used
to calculate the bond strength of adhesive anchors. See Clause D.6.5.1.
Side-face blowout strength — the strength of anchors with deeper embedment but thinner side cover
corresponding to concrete spalling on the side face around the embedded head while no major
breakout occurs at the top concrete surface. See Figure D.4A.
Specialty insert — a predesigned and prefabricated cast-in anchor specifically designed for attachment
of bolted or slotted connections. Specialty inserts are often used for handling, transportation, and
erection, but also for anchoring structural elements. They are not covered by this Annex.
Stretch length — length of anchor, extending beyond concrete in which it is anchored, subject to full
tensile load applied to anchor, and for which cross-sectional area is minimum and constant. See Figure
D.3.
Supplementary reinforcement — reinforcement that acts to restrain the potential concrete breakout
but is not designed to transfer the full design load from the anchors into the structural member.
Undercut anchor — a post-installed anchor that derives its tensile strength from the mechanical
interlock provided by undercutting of the concrete at the embedded end of the anchor. The
undercutting is achieved with a special drill before installation of the anchor or by the anchor itself
during its installation.

ψc,N = 1.25 for cast-in anchors; and
ψc,N = 1.4 for post-installed anchors when the value of kc = 7.0 is used in Equation D.6.
When the value of kc used in Equation D.6 is taken from an ACI 355.2 or ACI 355.4 product evaluation

D.7.1 Steel resistance of anchor in shear
D.7.1.1
The factored resistance of an anchor in shear as governed by steel, Vsar, shall be evaluated by
calculations based on the properties of the anchor material and the physical dimensions of the anchor.
Where concrete breakout is a potential failure mode, the required steel shear strength shall be
consistent with the assumed breakout surface.
D.7.1.2
The factored resistance of an anchor in shear shall not exceed the following Items a) to c):
a)
for cast-in headed stud anchors:
Equation D.30
where Ase,V is the effective cross-sectional area of an anchor in shear, mm2 and futa shall not be
taken greater than the smaller of 1.9fya or 860 MPa and R is as specified in Clause D.5.3;
b)
for cast-in headed bolts, hooked bolt anchors, and post-installed anchors where sleeves do not
extend through the shear plane:
Equation D.31
where Ase,V is the effective cross-sectional area of a single anchor in shear, mm2 and futa shall not
be taken greater than the smaller of 1.9fya or 860 MPa; and R is as specified in Clause D.5.3; and
c)
for post-installed anchors with sleeves extending through the shear plane, Vsar shall be based on
the 5% fractile of results of tests performed and evaluated in accordance with ACI 355.2. When this
procedure is used, Vsar shall be obtained by multiplying the resulting 5% fractile test value by

Alternatively, Equation D.31 may be used.

shall not exceed the following (see Figure D.4B):
a)

c)
For shear force parallel to an edge, Vcbr or Vcbgr may be twice the value for shear force determined

d)
For anchors located at a corner, the limiting factored concrete breakout resistance shall be
determined for each edge and the minimum value shall be used (see Figure D.14).
Factors ψec,V, ψed,V, ψc,V, and ψh,V are defined in Clauses D.7.2.5, D.7.2.6, D.7.2.7, and D.7.2.8,
respectively. Vbr is the factored concrete breakout resistance value for a single anchor. AVc is the
projected area of the failure surface on the side of the concrete member at its edge for a single anchor
or anchor group. This area may be evaluated as the base of a truncated half-pyramid projected on the
side face of the member where the top of the half-pyramid is given by the axis of the anchor row
selected as critical. The value of ca1 shall be taken as the distance from the edge to this axis. AVc shall
not exceed nAVco, where n is the number of anchors in the group. See Figure D.13.
AVco is the projected area for a single anchor in a deep member and with a distance from edges equal or
greater than 1.5ca1 in the direction perpendicular to the shear force. This area, AVco, may be evaluated
as the base of a half-pyramid with a side length parallel to the edge of 3ca1 and a depth of 1.5ca1, as
follows (see Figure D.12):
Equation D.34
Where anchors are located at varying distances from the edge and are welded to the attachment so as
to distribute the force to all anchors, the strength may be evaluated based on the distance to the
farthest row of anchors from the edge. In this case, the value of ca1 may be based on the distance from
the edge to the axis of the farthest anchor row that is selected as critical, and all of the shear shall be
assumed to be carried by this critical anchor row alone. See Figure D.13.

Clause D.7.2.1 as well as in Equation D.34 to D.38 and D.40 to D.42 shall not exceed the largest of
a)
ca2/1.5, where ca2 is the largest edge distance;
b)
ha/1.5; and
c)
s/3, where s is the maximum spacing perpendicular to direction of shear between anchors within a
group. See Figure D.15.

D.7.2.5
The modification factor for anchor groups loaded eccentrically in shear,
, shall be computed as
Equation D.38
This equation shall be valid for
Equation D.39
but Ψec,V, shall not be taken greater than 1.0.
Where s shall be taken as the distance between the outermost anchors in tension.
If the loading on an anchor group is such that only some anchors are loaded in shear in the same
direction, only those anchors that are loaded in shear in the same direction shall be considered when
determining the eccentricity of e′
V for use in Equation D.38 and for the calculation of Vcbgr in accordance
with Equation D.33. See Figure D.16.
D.7.2.6
The modification factor for edge effect for a single anchor or group of anchors loaded in shear, Ψed,V,
shall be computed as follows using the smaller value of ca2:

D.7.2.7
For anchors located in a region of a concrete member where an analysis that includes temperature and
shrinkage effects indicates no tension (ft < fr) at service loads, a modification factor of ψc,V = 1.4 may be
used.
For anchors located in a region of a concrete member where analysis indicates cracking at service load
levels, the following modification factors may be used:
For anchors in cracked concrete without supplementary
reinforcement or with edge reinforcement smaller than a
15M bar

The modification factor for anchors located in a concrete member where ha < 1.5ca1, ψh,V shall be
computed as
Equation D.42
but ψh,V shall not be taken less than 1.0.
D.7.2.9
Where anchor reinforcement is developed in accordance with Clause 12 on both sides of the breakout
surface or encloses the anchor and is developed beyond the breakout surface, the design strength of
the anchor reinforcement may be used instead of the concrete breakout strength in determining Vr. See
Figures D.17A and D.17B. The anchor reinforcement capacity shall be taken as

where R = 0.85.

Case 1: One assumption of the distribution of forces indicates that half of the shear force would be
critical on the front anchor and the projected area. For the calculation of concrete breakout, ca1 is taken
as ca1,1
Case 2: Another assumption of the distribution of forces indicates that the total shear force would be
critical on the rear anchor and its projected area. Only this assumption needs to be considered when
anchors are welded to a common plate independent of s. For the calculation of concrete breakout, ca1 is
taken as ca1,2
Note: For s ≥ca1,1, both Case 1 and Case 2 should be evaluated to determine which controls for design except as
noted for anchors welded to a common plate.
Case 3: Where s < ca1,1, apply the entire shear load V to the front anchor. This case does not apply for
anchors welded to a common plate. For the calculation of concrete breakout, ca1 is taken as ca1,1.

a)
The actual ca1 = 300 mm.
b)
The two edge distances ca2 as well as ha are all less than 1.5ca1.
c)
The limiting value of ca1 (shown as c ′
a1 in the figure) to be used for the calculation of AVc and in
Equations D.32 to D.38 and D.40 to D.42 is determined as the largest of the following:
(ca2,max)/1.5 = (175)/1.5 = 116.7 mm.
(ha)/1.5 = (200)/1.5 = 133.3 mm.
s/3 = 225/3 = 75 mm.
d)
For this case, AVc, AVco, ψed,V, and ψh,V are determined as follows:
AVc= (125 + 225 + 175)(1.5 x 133.3) = 105 000 mm2.
AVco = 4.5 x 133.32 = 80 000 mm2.
ψed,V = 0.7 + (0.3 x 125)/133.3 = 0.98
ψh,V = 1.0 because ca1 = (ha)/1.5. Point A shows the intersection of the assumed failure surface with
the concrete surface that establishes the limiting value of ca1.
